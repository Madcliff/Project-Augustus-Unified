EVTDESC6350;As I was lying in my bed at night I was suddenly woken by the hissing and growling of my favorite cat. The bedchamber was alive with scratching, scurrying noises, coming from the very walls themselves. I sprang from the bed, but the noises suddenly disappeared and a subsquent investigation of the chamber revealed nothing but patched stone walls.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6350;Could there be rats in the walls?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB6350;Just a dream, nothing more;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6351;The servant I had sent to fetch water never returned and when I went to investigate I noticed a strange light emanating from the well. I peered inside and saw a color like no color I had ever seen before. It was like smoke, cold and wet but burning my skin where it touched.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6351;That color is not from this earth!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB6351;The well must have gone bad;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6352;I had repeatedly questioned my servant about the locked mausoleum beneath the castle but it wasn't until today that I found the key, hidden inside a rotting chest in the oldest castle tower. Inside the tomb's dusty passageways I found an empty stone coffin which bore the inscription '[Root.GetFirstName] [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]'.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6352;This coffin looks comfortable to sleep in;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB6352;Well, that was morbid... seal the tomb!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6353;An old cottar and his wife who were known for their cruelty to cats were found dead in their home this morning, their bones picked clean of meat. My steward tells me that the local townspeople had their cats go missing the day before, but all the missing cats returned today looking fat and happy...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6353;Pass a law banning the killing of cats;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB6353;A coincidence, nothing more;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP6354;Somewhere, a dreamer stirs...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6354;Since the incident some weeks ago I have felt uneasy. I took a walk along the coast to clear my mind and found a small village where the people claimed to worship the 'Old Ones', Gods older than even those of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. They invited me to join in their rituals and showed me a dusty old grimoire written by a mad Saracen.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6354;I must study this grimoire;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP6355;[Root.GetBestName] learns the forbidden secrets;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6355;Intense study of the grimoire has gained me much knowledge. I have devised a ritual to awaken the most powerful of the Old Ones where he sleeps, dead but dreaming, in his watery tomb beneath the ocean. The cult has prepared the ritual attire and is gathering the necessary sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6355;Tonight, he will wake!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP6356;[Root.GetBestName] puts on a black robe and wizened old hat;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6356;The cult has gathered for the ritual on the shore of a black and stormy sea. The chanting begins, Ph'nglui mglw'nafh..., and in the depths of the dark waters something stirs...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6356;He comes! HE COMES!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB6356;What have I done?! I must stop this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP6357;[Root.GetBestName] commandeers a longboat;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6357;I steered the longboat through the raging waters towards the monstrous creature. It stood as tall as a castle tower, with the body of a man and the head of a great tentacled beast. I knew that I had awoken it from where it slept beneath the waves and that it was here to end the age of man. There was only one thing I could do...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6357;Ramming speed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP6358;A fateful collision...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6358;I awoke in my own bed weak and sweating. The servants told me that they had found me on the shore, naked and half-drowned. I asked them about the creature and the ship but they just looked at me with worried eyes and shook their heads. It seems I am the only living witness to these events.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_TOG_001;The Fall of Kiev;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_001;Brave Mongol warriors have poured through the Golden Gates of Kiev and sacked the once proud trading hub. The city has been left a smoldering ruin and the Dnieper now runs red with the blood of its former inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_001;They shall never forget our might.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_002;The Fall of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_002;Novgorod has been stormed by Mongol warriors and the city's inhabitants are now paying the ultimate price for their arrogance. The Cathedral of Saint Sophia is engulfed in flames as the warriors loot that which can be carried away and put the rest to the torch.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_003;The Fall of Krakow;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_003;Mongol armies continue to push beyond the Vistula and into Poland. Krakow has now fallen to the skilled warriors, and it is said that at night the flames from the burning city can be seen from untold leagues away.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_004;The Fall of Aachen;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_004;Even Aachen, the former seat of Charlemagne's Carolingian empire, has fallen under the shadow of the great Mongol nation. His spirit must surely be weeping at the harsh punishment now being brought down on the decadent peasants within the city's walls.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_005;The Fall of Paris;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_005;Like a swarm of locusts, the unstoppable Mongols have descended upon Paris and sacked the city. The still unfinished Notre Dame Cathedral is quickly set on fire and with the light provided by the rest of the burning city, the Mongol warriors can continue looting and murdering well into the night.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_006;The Fall of London;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_006;Not even the sea has proved a formidable enough barrier to halt the Mongol advance. London has fallen to the Mongol vanguard and the city is now the scene of a slaughter on a scale unrivaled since the days of Queen Boudica and her rebellion.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_007;The Fall of Rome;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_007;As is proper, Rome once more suffers at the just hands of warriors from the east. A Mongol army has breached the Aurelian Walls, and its horses are now grazing on the field of the Circus Maximus while the ranking officers raise their yurts on the Palatine Hill. As expected, no mercy is shown to those foolish Romans who have not yet fled the city.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_008;The Fall of Venice;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_008;The canals of Venice have been blocked by the bloated corpses of the dead as the city is sacked by frenzied Mongol warriors. Those few fortunate enough to have escaped the slaughter claim the bodies are packed tightly enough in the Venetian Lagoon for the Mongols to ride to and from the mainland as they please.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_009;The Fall of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_009;The Theodosian Walls have not been enough to spare Constantinople from the deadly touch of the Mongol nation. The great imperial capital has been sacked, its citizens butchered or enslaved, the Hagia Sophia defiled and the Great Palace of the emperors put to the torch.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_010;The Fall of Lisbon;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_010;Our armies have now reached as far west as Lisbon in the quest to conquer the world for the great Mongol nation. While the city burns at the touch of our warriors, they look out over the great blue expanse of the Atlantic. Who can tell what lies beyond?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_011;The Fall of Smolensk;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_011;Smolensk has been swallowed up by the Mongol horde as it continues its relentless advance to the west. When the great host finally moves on, little remains of the city but ashes and charred rubble, and those lucky few inhabitants who somehow escaped the notice of the rampaging horsemen.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_012;The Fall of Prague;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_012;The city of Prague has indeed become a beacon of light in an otherwise dark world, as Mongol warriors move from house to house and set fire to everything not yet looted. A flood of refugees spread horrific tales about the cruelty and skill of the bloodthirsty Tartar horsemen to every corner of Europe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_013;The Fall of Vienna;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_013;Vienna, a city previously of growing importance on the Danube river, has become the latest target of the great Mongol armies as they continue to pillage and burn their way across Europe. The smoking ruins and arrow-riddled corpses they leave behind when they move on do not lend much faith in the city's future prospects.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_014;The Fall of Esztergom;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_014;The great Mongol horde has reached beyond the Carpathians and fanned out across the Great Hungarian Plain. Now the city of Esztergom has fallen to the murderous host and is the scene of indiscriminate slaughter. Those that attempt to flee on foot are cut down without mercy by the fast horsemen as dark, billowing smoke rises towards the sky above the city.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_015;The Fall of Athens;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_015;The ancient city of Athens has fallen to the Mongols, and they now rampage unchecked behind its walls. Great monuments and artifacts dating back to the dawn of Western Civilisation are lost forever in a cultural desecration that will surely be felt by future generations thousands of years from now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_016;The Fall of Belgrade;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_016;The White City has turned red as the Mongol armies seize Belgrade and massacre the inhabitants without exception. After several days of slaughter and looting, the smell of death and rotting flesh proves too much even for our warriors to bear and they move their camp upwind from the scorched ruins of the city.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_017;The Fall of Baghdad;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_017;The decadent city of Baghdad, supposedly one of the world's foremost centers of learning, has succumbed to the unstoppable Mongol armies after a siege. Now the Tigris river runs not only red with blood, but black with the ink of priceless and irreplaceable tomes from the House of Wisdom and the city's other great libraries.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_018;The Fall of Damascus;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_018;Damascus, the ancient City of Jasmine, has been sacked by the advancing Mongols. Our warriors have gathered a colossal pile of severed heads on a field just outside the city walls, now renamed burj al-ru'us by the massacre's few survivors - the Tower of Heads.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_019;The Fall of Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_019;The great Mongol host has sacked Jerusalem, spurring a moment of rare solidarity between members of all the city's different religions as they suffer equal horrors under the righteous wrath of our warriors.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_020;The Fall of Alexandria;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_020;Not content with our vast empire surpassing Alexander the Great's in sheer size, Mongol armies are now laying waste to the city that is his namesake as well. Pompey's Pillar has been toppled, but sadly the Pharos Lighthouse is spared when the our warriors deem it not worth the great effort it would require to raze it to the ground.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_021;The Fall of Cairo;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_021;Riding through the fertile Nile Delta, a Mongol army has arrived at the Great Pyramids of Giza and breached the gates of Cairo. Surely even the cruelest Pharaoh would be given pause by the pain and misery now inflicted on the city's decadent and foolish population.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_022;The Fall of Mecca;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_022;The Muslim Holy City of Mecca now burns at the hands of Mongol warriors. Pilgrims journeying from distant lands to show their submission to Allah are met only with death when approaching the city gates. This desecration will be remembered for ages to come, hopefully as an important lesson on the price of defying the powerful Mongol nation.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_TOG_400;A new discovery!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_400;New land has been sighted across the sea to the west of Iceland! While sailing to Reykjavik from Norway, Gunnbj鷨n Ulfsson and his crew were blown off course and came upon several skerries lying off the coast of a much larger island ?possibly a new continent.\n\nWhile Gunnbj鷨n did not go ashore, the land seems to be unclaimed and unsettled. Sailors in Iceland have vowed to investigate this discovery further.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_400;What lies beyond, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_401;Settlers reach Greenland;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_401;The new land discovered to the west of Iceland does indeed seem to be a new island. Under the leadership of Erik the Red, who was banished from Iceland for murder, settlers have claimed land on the island's southwestern shores. To attract more colonists, Erik has cleverly decided on the promising name of Greenland for this untamed, virgin land.\n\nThe new colony has already started exporting walrus ivory, seal blubber and furs to Iceland and beyond. Apart from the brave Norse settlers, Greenland so far seems to be devoid of human life.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_401;Greenland, is it?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_402;Discovery of Vinland;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_402;After hearing stories of new land even further west of Greenland, Leif Eriksson, the son of Erik the Red, has mounted an expedition with a single longship and a crew of thirty-five. Days were spent at sea, but Leif and his crew finally sighted land and traveled south along the coast until they decided to winter at a place he named Vinland. When they returned to Greenland, the brave explorers brought with them a cargo of grapes and some much needed timber.\n\nUpon Leif's return, his brother Thorvald departed on a similar expedition to further map the coastline of this new land, but his shore party came to blows with Skr熞ings, the local natives, and Thorvald himself fell in battle. Despite this, future expeditions are already being planned to this rich and fertile land.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_402;A great discovery!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_TOG_403;The Realm of the Skr熞ings;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_403;Grave news from beyond the western sea! The explorer Thorfinn Karlsefni sailed towards Vinland with three full longships, intending to establish a permanent settlement in the new world. Sadly, while sailing further south along the coast of Vinland, they came upon a large party of heavily armed Skr熞ing warriors.\n\nThe Skr熞ings butchered the Norsemen and captured two of the three longships. Thorfinn himself was apparently sacrificed to their vengeful gods, but a few of his men were released so that they could bring warning back to Greenland. According to the survivors, the Skr熞ings then sailed the captured ships south, towards the cities of their great realm, where our ship-building techniques will be studied by their learned men.;;;;;;;;;x

hold_nerge_desc;In the Nerge, or the Great Hunt, an entire Mongol army hunts all wildlife in a vast expanse of wilderness. This not only provides food for the winter, but also improves discipline among the troops.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_100;You have sent out the call for the Nerge to your vassals. Preparations for the Great Hunt have begun, and your scouts have chosen a promising region that is rich with game. Mongol warriors are converging on the designated assembly points.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_100;Soon we shall see the mettle of these warriors.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_101;The call for the Great Hunt goes out.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_101;The great [From.GetTitle] has announced the beginning of the Nerge! This Great Hunt, which will last for several months, is nothing less than a massive training exercise where all arms of the Mongol army come together and are molded into a lethal fighting force. Your presence is required.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_101;As my [From.GetTitle] commands.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_102;The preparations for the Nerge have been completed, and your forces are deployed at the assembly points! They will now advance in formation, driving all wildlife before them until they are trapped and surrounded in a large clearing prepared by your scouts. Then the killing begins.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_102;Let the hunt commence!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_103;The preparations for the Nerge have been completed, and the [From.GetTitle]'s  forces are deployed at the assembly points! Together, you will now advance in formation, driving all wildlife before you until they are trapped and surrounded in a large clearing prepared by the [From.GetTitle]'s scouts. Then the killing begins.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_110;While guiding the advance in your assigned sector of the Nerge, your horse was suddenly startled by a fox bolting from its hiding place. You were thrown off your saddle, and when you regained consciousness you found your arm painfully twisted at a strange angle. It looks like this hunt is over for you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_110;What rotten luck.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_111;While guiding the advance in his assigned sector of the Nerge, [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s horse was suddenly startled by a fox bolting from its hiding place. He was thrown off his saddle and broke his arm. For him, the hunt is over.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_111;More game for the rest of us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_112;Your forces continue to drive wildlife before them, but as they pass a small creek, their lines collide with forces under [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s command! The cohesion of your forces has been broken, and when [From.GetFirstName] chastises you in front of your men, you come to blows with the man!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_112;That arrogant fool.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_113;Word has reached you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] came to blows with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] in front of their men, when their advancing lines became entangled in one another. No wildlife seems to have escaped, and the matter has been settled between the men. They will likely hold a grudge, however...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_113;They need to focus on their duties.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_114;You have failed to keep the advance of your men orderly, and as a result gaps have opened up in your lines. It's impossible to tell how much wildlife has escaped the encirclement, but some is bound to have slipped through the cracks. When the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] learns of this, [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] will not be pleased...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_114;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_115;Through incompetence, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has failed to properly maintain his lines resulting in a large gap forming in the encirclement. Much wildlife has escaped, and tradition dictates that [From.GetFirstName] and his men be punished severely. Failure to do so could disrupt discipline among the other troops.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_115;The fool will pay for his mistakes.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_115;I will show leniency this time...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_116;A severe clubbing is administered.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_116;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle], in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] wisdom, has decided to punish you and your men for your failure to maintain formation. Your life shall be spared, but you will be severely clubbed as a lesson to all. Unit cohesion must be maintained at all times.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_116;Let's get this over with then...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_117;As you advance together with your men in the Nerge, you suddenly spot a large and magnificent buck standing in a small clearing. Without thinking you raise your bow and fire an arrow. You score a direct hit and the animal falls to the ground, but you are in trouble now ?no animals may be killed at this stage in the hunt.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_117;Oops.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_118;While advancing with his forces, [From.GetTitledFirstName] felled a buck with his bow. This is unacceptable ?per ancient tradition, no animals may be killed during the Nerge before the encirclement has been completed. A harsh punishment for this transgression will be expected.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_118;Punish the fool!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_118;A reprimand will be enough.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_150;The horde of frantic animals has been corralled into a clearing and they are now completely surrounded by your forces. As the [Root.GetTitle], you and your closest retinue will be given the first opportunity to engage in the killing sport. Only after you are finished will your vassals be allowed to hunt.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_150;Hand me my bow.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_151;The horde of frantic animals has been corralled into a clearing and they are now completely surrounded by the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s forces. As is [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] right, the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] and [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] closest retinue will start the killing. When [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] is finished, it will be your turn along with the other vassals.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_151;At last.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_152;You spend a few hours hunting the trapped game, and it soon becomes obvious to everyone that you have a real knack for this. The arrows from your bow easily find their marks, and you seem better able than most in predicting the behavior of the animals.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_152;These furs will warm me in the cold winter months.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_158;One of your warriors has demonstrated exceptional skill during the Nerge, both in sheer martial ability and in the art of effectively commanding a large body of men. He is brought before his [Root.GetTitle], and your advisors suggest that you consider elevating him into a position in your court.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_158;Yes, make it so.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_158;No, he belongs with the other soldiers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_159;As a gift, one of your warriors participating in the Great Hunt has offered you an exceptional bear cub that he managed to tie up and capturing while advancing with the rest of your forces. The animal's fur is white and its eyes are a deep red ?it seems to be an albino.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_159;Thank you for this gift.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_159;Rid me of this abomination!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_160;A high-pitched shriek outside your yurt draws your attention. As you push the flaps aside, you spot [From.GetTitledFirstName] lying wounded on the ground not far from your chained pet albino bear. It looks like [From.GetSheHe] got too close to the powerful animal. You return back inside your yurt to focus on more important matters.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_160;Now where was I...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_161;A high-pitched shriek outside your yurt draws your attention. As you push the flaps aside, you spot [From.GetTitledFirstName] lying maimed on the ground not far from your chained pet albino bear. It looks like [From.GetSheHe] got too close to the powerful animal. You return back inside your yurt to focus on more important matters.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_162;A high-pitched shriek outside your yurt draws your attention. As you push the flaps aside, you spot [From.GetTitledFirstName] lying dead on the ground not far from your chained pet albino bear. It looks like [From.GetSheHe] got too close to the powerful animal. You return back inside your yurt to focus on more important matters.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_163;Some visiting foreign dignitaries who have come to offer tribute to you, the great [Root.GetTitle], have become very impressed with your pet albino bear. They claim never to have seen such a magnificent beast, and that you must be a powerful leader indeed to have enslaved it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_163;It is the truth.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_164;Some travelers from faraway Hindustan have offered to teach your pet bear to dance, and you have accepted their offer. After spending many months at your court, they have succeeded and you have become renowned throughout the world as the mighty [Root.GetTitle] with the dancing white bear.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_164;I... I can't stop... dancing...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_165;Your pet albino bear does not seem to be feeling well. It refuses to eat, and its handlers are at a loss to explain what might be wrong with it. Could it be that the proud animal has grown tired of its chains and yearns to be free?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_165;Release the bear back into the wilds.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_165;Nonsense. It's better off here.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_166;Sadly, you discovered this morning that your pet albino bear has passed away. The poor animal will get a proper funeral.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_166;A dark day...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_169;As per tradition, some of your older soldiers have come before you to plead for the life of those few animals that remain in the encircled clearing. Their release, as a display of the [Root.GetTitle]'s mercy, usually signals the end of the Nerge, and the beginning of nine days of feasting.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_169;Yes. As is tradition, these animals shall not be harmed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_169;No, kill them all! No survivors!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_170;With the hunt over and the fallen game collected, a magnificent feast has been prepared for all who took part. The next nine days will be ones of drunken revelry and celebration.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_170;Let us drink and be merry!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_180;With the feasting over, the remaining spoils of the hunt are divided evenly between all of the forces that participated. As everyone departs, you survey the surrounding land. It will be some time before the wildlife in this region recovers from this slaughter, but when that happens, the time will be ripe for another Great Hunt.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_180;May it go as well as this one did.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_181;With the present war, the Great Hunt has been called off and you and your men will have to get your training hunting the most dangerous game of all ?Man. Perhaps when the dust has settled and peace returned, a new Nerge can be organized.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_181;A different breed of hunt, but a hunt all the same.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_601;Summoned to blot.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_602;Exempted from blot.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_601;Your wise liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has summoned you and [From.GetHerHis] other vassals to a blot. There you will worship and give sacrifice to the gods before taking part in a great feast where you drink to their name.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_601;I wouldn't miss it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_602;Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], remains trapped in [From.GetHerHis] heathen ways, and now [From.GetSheHe] has summoned all of [From.GetHerHis] vassals to a blot where [From.GetSheHe] intends to give sacrifice to [From.GetHerHis] pagan gods. Since you do not practise their heathen religion, you will be expected to contribute gold in order to be exempted from this ceremony.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_602;I suppose I have no choice in the matter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_602;As [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] is my witness, I shan't pay!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_603;Your payment is received.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_603;[From.GetTitledFirstName], your vassal, is stubborn in [From.GetHerHis] ways and speaks only of the mercy of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], but [From.GetSheHe] has wisely decided to offer you some gold to be exempted from the blot.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_603;As well [From.GetSheHe] should.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_636;Your refusal to pay is received.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_636;Despite having sworn you fealty, [From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to offer gold in order to be exempted from the blot! According to [From.GetFirstName], [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] would not forgive [From.GetHerHim] if [From.GetSheHe] contributed as much as a single copper to a heathen festival.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_636;This insult will not be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_604;The guests have arrived, and the time has come for the blot to begin! You gather outside the temple, and start by offering animals as sacrifice to the gods. While their meat is prepared for the feast that is to follow, the blood is sprinkled on statues of Odin, Thor, Freyr and the other gods, as well as on the worshippers themselves.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_604;Now for the human sacrifice...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_605;The time has come for the blot held by [From.GetTitledFirstName] to begin! You gather outside the temple, and start by offering animals as sacrifice to the gods. While their meat is prepared for the feast that is to follow, the blood is sprinkled on statues of Odin, Thor, Freyr and the other gods, as well as on the worshippers themselves.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_606;Although you have been told little, the noise from outside your dungeon is enough to make it clear that your captor, [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] is holding a blot where [Root.Host.GetSheHe] will offer sacrifice in worship of [Root.Host.GetHerHis] gods. Guards burst inside your cell and drag you away to the gallows outside the local temple... ;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_606;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_610;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. A noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck and the rope is thrown over a sturdy branch of a nearby oak. A small yellow pool forms at [From.GetFirstName]'s feet.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_610;Allfather, we offer you this sacrifice...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_610;No, I have changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_611;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetSheHe] steadies [From.GetHerselfHimself] and murmurs several passages that you recognize as being from the Christian holy book.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_611;Where is your Blessed Virgin now, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_611;No, perhaps this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_612;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Your guards place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck while [From.GetSheHe] murmurs a passage with closed eyes from the Mohammedan holy book.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_612;Soon you shall meet your Prophet, friend.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_612;No, perhaps this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_613;Your brother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is brought up from his dungeon and escorted to the temple. As the noose is placed around his neck, he looks at you with pleading eyes. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]. There has to be some other way...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_613;I'm afraid not. Do it, men.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_613;No, I can't do this to my own brother...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_614;Your sister, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up from her dungeon and escorted to the temple. She looks up at you with tears streaming down her face as your guards place the noose around her neck. Please, [Root.GetFirstName], she says with a trembling voice. Don't let them do this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_614;There can be no turning back now. I'm sorry.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_614;No... not my own sister...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_615;The guards drag your father, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and escort him to the temple where they place the noose around his neck. My [Root.GetSonDaughter], he croaks while looking at you. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_615;No.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_615;I can't do this to my own father...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_616;Distant screaming can be heard as your guards drag your mother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from her dungeon. They bring her to the temple and as they place the noose around her neck, she looks at you with pleading eyes. W-why would you do this to your own mother?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_616;Because I can.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_616;I... I wouldn't...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_617;The guards fetch your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and lead him to the temple. There a noose is placed around his neck and the rope is thrown over a sturdy branch of a nearby oak. Before your men pull at the rope, your son looks at you with tearful eyes. Please don't, [Root.GetFatherMother]... please don't.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_617;Do it, men.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_617;I can't do this... not to my own boy...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_618;Your daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is pulled from her dungeon and brought to the temple by your guards. As they place the noose around her neck, she looks at you with a desperate yet piercing glare. Is this really what you have been reduced to, [Root.GetFatherMother]? To do this... against your own daughter?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_618;You have left me with little choice.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_618;No, send her back... not to my girl...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_619;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought from your dungeons by the guards and placed at the gallows in front of the temple. As they place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetFirstName] cries out to you. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]! We are family and of the same blood!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_619;Yes, and that only proves my devotion to Odin.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_619;It is true... [From.GetSheHe] is kin.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_620;Your spouse, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged to the gallows in front of the temple and your guards place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck. In a last desperate effort to save  [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetFirstName] calls out to you for mercy. I have always loved you, [Root.GetFirstName]... and I always will.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_620;Forgive me then, my love, but this is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_620;No, this is too much... I can't permit it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_621;From deep within your dungeons, your guards bring out [From.GetTitledFirstName], your Skr熞ing prisoner. As they drag [From.GetHerHim] to the front of the temple and place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck, the Skr熞ing shouts something in [From.GetHerHis] own language and stares at you defiantly.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_621;Let us show you how a proper human sacrifice is done.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_621;No, this brave Skr熞ing shall live to see another day.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_622;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is dragged to the great oak in front of the temple and a noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck. Soon [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s body dangles limply in the cold breeze from one of the tree branches.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_622;This should please the gods!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_623;Your liege's guards have brought a Christian, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the big oak in front of the temple. As the noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] continues to prattle on about the Holy Spirit and how we shall all suffer in Hell for our sins... but soon [FromFrom.GetSheHe] speaks no more.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_624;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a Mohammedan from your liege's dungeons, has been brought to the temple and will now be sacrificed to the gods. As the noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] quotes a passage from their holy book right up until the rope tightens and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] feet rise off the ground.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_625;Your liege has told [From.GetHerHis] men to fetch [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own brother, from the dungeons. [From.GetFirstName] betrays no emotion as [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is brought up to the gallows in front of the temple, and soon his limp body can be seen slowly dangling back and forth in the wind.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_626;It seems your liege has decided to sacrifice [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own sister, to the gods. She has been brought out from [From.GetFirstName]'s dark dungeons, and while she squints her eyes in the unfamiliar daylight, the guards place a noose around her neck.

EVTDESC_TOG_628;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], the mother of your liege, appears at the temple flanked by guards, and to your surprise they escort her right up to the gallows.

EVTDESC_TOG_632;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently decided to sacrifice [From.GetHerHis] own spouse, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the gods, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has been brought in chains to the temple.

You know he took part in several battles and killed many foes, but instead of reveling in the glory of his accomplishments, [From.GetFirstName] is plagued by nightmares and jumps at sudden sounds.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3123;Strange...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3125;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from Miklag緳d and his service with the Varangian Guard, but he is not alone. He has found a Greek wife and brought her with him. She is not familiar with our customs or language, and the climate does not seem to agree with her, but she seems willing to make the best of her new home.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3125;Each to their own.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3127;After many years in Greece, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally been released from his service to the Varangian Guard and returned home. Your son is a changed man, however. The old gods no longer hold any interest for him, and he instead speaks incessantly of Christendom and the horrors that await those who refuse to convert...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3127;I knew those Greeks would be a bad influence.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3129;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Miklag緳d and the Varangian Guard as a changed man. He is wiser, more confident in his own abilities and more knowledgeable in matters of war. It seems the time spent in Greece did him good.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3129;Welcome home, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3131;Several former Varangian Guardsmen have recently returned home after serving the Greek king, and they bring news most grave. Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], fell in battle while campaigning in Serkland. They assure you that he faced his enemy with bravery and slew many before their numbers overwhelmed him.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3131;He died a hero...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3133;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has at last returned from Greece on a longship filled with the spoils of war! Apparently the great king of the Greeks is generous to those who serve him well, and there is gold here from all over the Greek realm, Serkland and beyond. Your son insists on sharing these riches with you, his loving father.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3133;[From.GetFirstName], you make me proud!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3134;Upon learning of the death of your father, you left the Varangian Guard and departed Miklag緳d for home on a longship filled with loot from your campaigns in Serkland. It was a long and perilous journey back, but your feet are now firmly planted on the soil of the land that is your birthright. The throne is yours.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3134;It is as I remember it.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_802;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has declined your invitation to attend the festival! Apparently [From.GetSheHe] has no faith in Jarilo, Perun or the other gods, and instead follows the strange rituals of some other religion that is foreign to our ways.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_803;Your vassals have arrived and the time has come to begin your celebration of Jarilo and the coming of spring. As per tradition, one of them will be chosen to be paraded around as a representation of Jarilo himself. Who shall it be?;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_3200;A woman claiming to be a v闤va, a seeress, has been brought before you and she asks to join your court. If her sejdr sorcery is as strong as she claims and she can truly glimpse into the future, her services could prove invaluable...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TOG_3200;No, send the witch away.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3201;There are rumors of a young woman from an isolated farm in [Root.Capital.GetName] who has been gifted with the mysterious powers of sejdr.

EVTDESC_TOG_3202;A faint whisper draws your attention and you find a haggard old crone in a dark corner of your longhouse.

EVTDESC_TOG_3211;It is the dead of night when a sudden chill comes upon you.

EVTOPTA_TOG_3211;Was it a dream?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3213;[From.GetFirstName] is sitting on the floor, playing with [From.GetHerHis] toys when something dark suddenly seems to come over the child.

EVTDESC_TOG_3252;[From.GetTitledName] ambushes you as you leave your longhouse and speaks to you in a pleading voice. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] must be purged of the evil [FromFrom.GetSheHe] carries within [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. There is no other way. I can perform a galdr ritual, but I won't lie - the child may or may not survive the ordeal. Nevertheless, the demon must be vanquished.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3252;Perform the ritual.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_3252;If you so much as touch [FromFrom.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3253;The galdr ritual to cleanse your spawn of evil has begun. The child is brought to a raised platform in a grove where [FromFrom.GetFirstName] awaits surrounded by chanting maidens.

EVTOPTA_TOG_3256;[This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] preserve us...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3257;A solemn procession of maidens led by [From.GetTitledName] finally emerges from the grove, but there is no sign of [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. It is done, [From.GetFirstName] announces. The demon is no more... but I fear there was no way to save your child. The corruption simply went too deep.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3257;Then your life is forfeit as well, witch!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TOG_3258;Thank the gods!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3259;The chanting from the grove comes closer and [From.GetTitledName] appears together with [FromFrom.GetFirstName], flanked on either side by singing maidens.

I fear it has left scars on [FromFrom.GetFirstName] that may never heal...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3218;The corpse of [From.GetTitledName] was discovered today at the bottom of a steep ravine with a broken neck. It seems to have been a tragic accident ordained by the gods, but strangely, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was seen standing next to the ravine, peering down into it just before the tragedy was revealed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3218;Curious...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3221;[From.GetTitledName] was found impaled on a wooden fence just outside your longhouse this morning. You can only deduce that [From.GetSheHe] fell on the fence from the roof of your longhouse, though what business [From.GetSheHe] had up there you cannot fathom. Poor [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was the first one to lay eyes on the gruesome scene...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3221;Yes, an interesting coincidence...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3224;[From.GetTitledName] was found stuffed head first into a barrel full of rain water this morning, with only [From.GetHerHis] pale, rigid legs visible above the surface.

BM_THE_MONGOLS_DESC;After uniting the warring steppe tribes under a single banner for the first time, the great warlord Temujin, or Genghis Khan as he now styles himself, has set out to expand his growing empire further. In Central Asia, Mongolian envoys to Ala ed-Din of Khwarezm have been massacred and this is an insult the Great Khan cannot ignore. He has led his armies west and now stands poised to punish the powerful Muslim realm for its insolence. Like a coiled spring, the massed Mongol armies are ready to be unleashed upon the world. Where will they stop?;;;;;;;;;x

miaphysite_DESC;Miaphysite Christianity encompasses the Coptic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church.

EVTOPTA62101;Off to the dungeons with [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;x 
raised_runestone;Raised Runestone;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_680;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. When [From.GetSheHe] sees the dangling noose about to be placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetSheHe] pushes the nearest guard aside and makes a desperate run for it, but to no avail. Your men drag [From.GetHerHim] kicking and screaming back to the temple.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_681;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Even as the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetFirstName] stares vacantly ahead without betraying any emotion whatsoever. It would seem [From.GetSheHe] has accepted [From.GetHerHis] fate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_682;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As soon as [From.GetSheHe] spots you among those gathered nearby, [From.GetSheHe] hurls insults and spittle your way, continuing even as the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck. The hatred in [From.GetHerHis] eyes cannot be mistaken.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3300;As your men return from looting the holding, one of them hands you an axe with a strange purple sheen and a plus etched into the handle, followed by the number two. After weighing it carefully in your hands, you toss aside your old, grey axe in favor of the new weapon.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3300;I feel stronger.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7701;Through my sources I have learned that our mutual problem will be touring a city in an open carriage. The guards will keep a close watch on the streets, but will they expect bowmen on the rooftops?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7721;Watching the animal pens outside [Root.Location.GetName] gave me an idea. Concentrated manure can be a very explosive substance, and if enough is gathered in a single place and ignited, the blast could prove lethal...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7741;If that whelp we are plotting against is to die, we will need to buy the loyalty of someone unscrupulous nearby, like a maid or a guard.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7761;The fact that the target of our plot is in prison can work to our advantage. If we could get someone on the inside to deal with our little problem and make it look like a failed escape attempt...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7781;The target of our plot may be a drooling, incapable mess, but it is still a very much alive drooling, incapable mess. Every month servants give our little problem a sorely needed bath, during which so many things could go wrong... especially if those servants were in our employ.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7801;Whispers have reached my ears that the target of the plot I am backing is due to embark on a little boat trip. I have it on good authority that the child has not yet learned to swim. If the boat was to flounder... well, these things happen all the time, don't they?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7821;There are snakes out there who can fell a grown man instantly with a single bite. If such a viper was to make a visit to a certain someone's bedchambers at night...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7841;I have learned that our mutual problem likes to take in the morning air on a balcony. The fall would be a long one indeed if someone was to take a tumble from there... perhaps the railing could be adjusted slightly.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7861;The young nuisance we are plotting against will soon be going on hunting trip to learn about the majesty of the wilds. With hounds and other dangerous beasts running around, not to mention arrows flying in every direction, so many things could go wrong during a hunt...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7881;The target of the plot I am backing will soon travel by carriage on an isolated road. Perhaps if we gathered some mercenaries and disguised them as highwaymen... crime is on the rise, after all.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC7901;The target we are plotting against will soon embark on a lengthy journey by carriage, during which so many things could go wrong. If we could buy the loyalty of the carriage driver...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC262;During the battle, you fearlessly charged ahead on horseback directly into the enemy ranks. Members of your personal guard riding beside you tumbled off their horses as enemy arrows found their marks, but your charge plowed straight into the enemy skirmishers and your sword ran red with their blood.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC263;While riding ahead with your personal guard, you suddenly found yourselves isolated on the battlefield and surrounded by enemy soldiers. A violent melee ensued but you gave a good account of yourself and managed to return to the main body of your army in time to lead it to victory.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC264;You were in the thick of it during the battle, and your tally of slain enemy soldiers has impressed even the most grizzled sergeants in your army. As you clean the blood splatter off your sword and armor, the men cheer you for the bravery you displayed in securing this victory.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC265;Using your foot as leverage, you pull your sword out of the dead corpse of the last foeman to fall by your hand in the battle. All around you, the men are cheering as the routing enemy soldiers flee in wild panic. Victory has been achieved, in large part thanks to your heroic efforts!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC266;Your commanding presence on the battlefield was felt during the recent victory, by friends and foes alike. You bolstered the spirits of the men when it was needed most, and you personally led the final charge that broke the back of the enemy army.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC267;As the enemy scurries away from the battlefield like frightened rabbits, you wipe the sweat off your brow and watch in silence. It was a hard-fought melee, and you were in the thick of it, personally leading your men to victory. Not only have you won this battle, but also a great deal of respect.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA262;Songs will be sung of this day.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3301;A strange chest made of an unknown metal was recovered by your men while they looted the holding. Try as they might, they haven't been able to force the chest open and its contents remain a mystery. It has now been deposited into your care.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3301;One day, that chest will be opened. Mark my words.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3302;While looting the holding, one of your men came upon a strange looking key made of an unknown metal. As you examine it, the metal reminds you of that mysterious chest you recovered earlier. Perhaps there is a connection!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3302;Let us see if the key will fit!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3303;While looting the holding, one of your men came upon a strange looking key made of an unknown metal. You have only seen such a metal once before ?that mysterious chest that has been inherited and passed along in your family. It's still gathering dust somewhere in your chambers... could this be the key that opens it?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3303;Let us find out! ;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3306;The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. It is filled with ancient gold coins, carved with the likeness of the long-dead Emperors of Rome and words written in their strange language!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3306;A small fortune!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3307;The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. Disappointingly, it contains only a few parched scrolls that crumble into dust at your touch. Whatever wisdom they held has been forever lost to the world.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3307;Just my luck.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3308;The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. Sadly, it is filled with nothing but worthless baubles and various trinkets. There is not a trace of gold to be found here, but the contents of the chest could probably be traded away for a few coins at least.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3308;Better than nothing, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3309;The key fits the lock, and you slowly open the chest. It contains nothing but dust! As you run your hand through it, strange lights begin to manifest in the room and you close your eyes when the first ghostly apparitions appear. You hear the screams of your guards, and when you finally open your eyes again, the spectres are gone... and your guards have been reduced to ash.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3309;This... this chest needs to be buried...;;;;;;;;;x 
opens_chest;You hurry to the chest...;;;;;;;;;x 
found_chest;You stow the chest safely away for now.;;;;;;;;;x 
chest_empty;You walk away disappointed.;;;;;;;;;x 
seraphims;You have the chest buried and vow never to speak a word of it to another soul.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_3320;The pillaging and looting undertaken in your name has earned you a reputation as a fearsome Viking raider. All along the coasts of Europe, mothers tucking their children in for the night warn that unless they behave, the terrible [Root.GetFirstName], scourge of the seas, will come ashore with his undead warriors and eat them.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3320;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME39640;The Rise of the Shi'a;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC39640;The schism at the heart of Islam dates back to its earliest days. The majority Sunnis have long persecuted the followers of Ali, the Shias, forcing them into hiding. The partisans of Ali look to his descendants for leadership, but they are forced to keep their ancestry secret. Now though, the Shias are mobilizing their strength behind a boy whom they claim to be Ali's rightful heir and Imam. Other Islamic jurists claim that the boy is clearly a fraud, but to his followers he is the person they have been waiting for and now they flock to his banner.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA39640;He is but a mere boy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB39640;For Allah and Ali!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC39640;The schismatics must be crushed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD39640;Ha! The fools fight amongst themselves.;;;;;;;;;x
