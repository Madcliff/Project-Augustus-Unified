horse_regret;Saved Instead of Favorite Horse;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_6000;You go out into the herd to choose a strong and powerful warhorse. You look around with expert eyes and eventually spot a steed that stands out from the rest. It is strong and has a powerful bearing.\n\nAs you mount your new steed, you feel certain that you have made the right choice. All that remains now is to give it a suitable name - what shall it be?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_6000;Dragon.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_6000;Sky.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_HL_6000;Arrow.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_HL_6000;Lightning.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_6010;Your ward, [ward_cant_ride.GetFirstName], is almost eight years old now and still cannot ride a horse properly. It is truly a disgrace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_6010;This will not do! I shall teach [ward_cant_ride.GetHerHim] personally.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_6010;What a useless child. Let [ward_cant_ride.GetHerHim] flounder.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_HL_6020;The River Crossing;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_6020;Traveling from one of your camps to the next, you come upon a river. Rains have made it swell and the rapids are strong and violent. The way around is too long, however, so you must cross. You watch with concern as the party gingerly begins to descend into the churning waters. [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName], your [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetHusbandWife], crosses riding your favorite horse.\n\nYou are watching from the bank as it suddenly happens... [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName] loses control in the strong rapids and falls off the horse as it loses its footing, and both of them are grabbed by the strong current. You realize that you only have a moment to react before they are swept away, you cannot save them both...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_6020;I must save [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_6020;I must save Dragon!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_HL_6020;I must save Sky!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_HL_6020;I must save Arrow!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTE_HL_6020;I must save Lightning!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_6021;You managed to pull [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName] out of the river. You lost your favorite horse, but your [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetHusbandWife] is safe. [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetSheHeCap] is terrified but overjoyed at the narrow escape and your brave rescue.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_6021;I am glad [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetSheHe]'s safe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_6021;Alas, I lost Dragon...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_HL_6021;Alas, I lost Sky...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_HL_6021;Alas, I lost Arrow...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTE_HL_6021;Alas, I lost Lightning...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_6022;You managed to pull [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetFirstName] out of the river. Once safe, [spouse_danger_nomad_river_crossing.GetSheHe] stands up, dripping wet and shivering, and curses you: 'You imbecile! I would have been fine! How could you let that fine horse drown?';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_6022;I, too, now question my decision.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_6030;One of your loyal retinue warriors has approached you with a petition for aid. He says his family lost several of their mares to illness and now they are struggling to feed their children.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_6030;You shall have six mares from my personal herd.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_6030;Unfortunate, but I cannot help you.;;;;;;;;;x 
feudal_government_desc;Feudal government revolves around the oath between liege and vassal, and Feudal lords can only directly own so many Holdings before they must start to rely on vassals - whose loyalty may vary... There are several Succession Laws to pick between - each with its own merits. The Centralization Law controls the maximum size of your Demesne and the number of direct vassals you can have. If you should convert to a religion in the Muslim group, your government form will change to Iqta.;;;;;;;;;x 
muslim_government_desc;The Arabic Iqta system is similar to the Feudal system - rulers must rely on land holding vassals or varying loyalty and ambition. The maximum number of vassals and the number of Holdings you can directly own are controlled by the Centralization Law. However, there is only one form of Succession available - the chaotic 'Open' type, where the son with most land inherits. If you should convert to a non-Muslim religion, your government form will change to Feudal.;;;;;;;;;x
