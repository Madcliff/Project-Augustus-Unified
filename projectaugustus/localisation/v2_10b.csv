EVTDESC_RoI_403;Ganges is the embodiment of all sacred waters in Hindu mythology and is personified in the goddess Ganga. As you live fairly close to this great river, your Upadhyaya suggests that you make a visit.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_RoI_403;I have no time.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_404;You have arrived at the banks of the Ganges. You enter a temple at the banks of the river, avoiding the throng of the common pilgrims. The sacred waters offer a ritual of purification and will strengthen your link to the divine.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_404;I descend into the water and Ganga washes away my sins.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_3150;Your court guru doesnt' talk much. He gives strange advice and has also been caught drinking on several occasions. You're beginning to doubt that he's a real guru.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_RoI_3150;Who cares?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_3151;You've had your court guru watched for several weeks. He secretly drinks and smokes herbs, he keeps sneaking out to pleasure houses in disguise, and spends the money he gets from donations on playing cards.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_3151;I must confront him.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_3151;Actually, that's my kind of guru.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_3152;As you confront your court guru over his habits, he breaks down and pleads for mercy: 'I confess, I'm an impostor. Please have mercy on me - I'm just a common man trying to make a living.';;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_RoI_411;This is none of my concern.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_412;There have been increasing complaints from merchants in the nearby town lately. It seems a number of naked Jain ascetics have taken to sit and preach in the main square. The merchants say they understand the need to respect other religions, but the naked ascetics are driving away customers and upsetting people's sensitivities.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_412;Why do you bother me with this petty nonsense?;;;;;;;;;x

However, we have learned that there is a healer in a neighboring province who is famous for healing ailing elephants. He is, however, most expensive...';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_163;How unfortunate for you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_163;I shall pay for it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_164;My [Root.GetLordLady], messengers have arrived from the great [From.GetFullName]. It seems [From.GetSheHe] has decided to honor you with the grandest of all gifts, a white elephant!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_164;I will accept this gracious gift.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_164;I will not accept it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_165;You will need to build a proper stable for your white elephant. It is a unique and holy animal and must have an abode fitting its status.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_165;I shall build it a house of fine woods and gold.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_165;A normal elephant pen will do.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_166;My [Root.GetLordLady], the guards keeping watch over your white elephant report that they have caught some trespassers. It seems they are members of a rather strange local Ganesha cult, and they have been stealing the white elephant's dung for worship.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_166;Kill the blasphemers!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_166;No harm done, give them the droppings as a gift.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_RoI_166;Let them work in the stables. We will pay them with dung.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_167;Your white elephant has still not gotten used to its new housing, and it seems restless and bored. Last night it got worse, it started kicking around and going on a rampage, almost tearing the whole place apart.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_167;Just repair it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_167;I've had enough, return this cursed gift.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_RoI_167;Sell the damned thing.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_RoI_167;This stupid animal needs to die - now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_168;My [Root.GetLordLady], there is a problem with your white elephant. Yesterday, it broke out from its stable and ran out into to the nearby fields. Once there, it immediately attempted to mate with several elephants - this desire may actually have been the reason for its escape.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_168;From now on, make sure it gets weekly 'exercise'.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_168;I've had enough, return the lecherous beast.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_RoI_168;Hmm, maybe we could sell it for breeding.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_RoI_168;Kill this elephant. Now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_169;If you truly wish to kill the White Elephant, you must decide how to proceed, my [Root.GetLordLady]. Whichever method we employ, we should try to make it look like an accident so as to avoid insulting the person who gave it to us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_169;Poison it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_169;Let's just starve it to death.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_RoI_169;Push it over a cliff.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_RoI_169;I don't care who's insulted. Send in the soldiers with lances.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_170;The caretakers poison the white elephant's drinking water. The elephant soon starts to wail in pain and becomes quite sick. It is a slow poison, and it takes several days for the beast to expire. Everyone is very concerned and very sad at this sudden 'illness'. No one suspects that you had the elephant poisoned.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_170;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_171;The caretakers poison the white elephant's drinking water. The elephant soon starts to wail in pain and becomes quite sick, vomiting blood and dying within minutes. Most people think it very strange that such a healthy animal suddenly died so quickly. Rumor quickly spreads that you had it poisoned.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_171;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_172;You instruct the caretakers to stop feeding the elephant. The animal gets progressively weaker and weaker until one morning it is found dead. You have your servants and medics complain loudly about the animal having been sick and refusing to eat. Everyone is sad, but no one suspects foul play.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_172;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_173;You instruct the caretakers to stop feeding the elephant. The animal gets progressively weaker and weaker until one morning it is found dead. Word gets out, however, that your servants had stopped delivering food to the stable and soon it is common knowledge that you starved the elephant to death.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_173;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_174;You arrange to bring the white elephant on an official procession very near some high cliffs. At the right moment, the guards prod the elephant with spears and drive it over the cliff, and it falls to its death. You swiftly have the guards spread the news of the terrible accident. Everyone is shocked, but no one suspects your involvement.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_174;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_175;You arrange to bring the white elephant on an official procession very near some high cliffs. At the right moment, the guards prod the elephant with spears and drive it over the cliff, and it falls to its death. Unluckily, however, some hunters passing by witnessed the whole incident, and rumor of your bloody deed swiftly spread throughout the realm.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_175;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_176;You send twenty soldiers armed with lances into the white elephant's stable. They attack and swiftly kill the animal in a few very noisy and bloody moments. Everyone knows it was done on your direct orders, and that's exactly the way you want it to be.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_176;It had to be done.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_177;The white elephant seems to be a lot calmer now, and hasn't broken anything or injured anyone in quite a while. It seems that perhaps our troubles with it are over.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_177;Let's hope so.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_180;A group of wandering Buddhist monks have come to visit the province. They are staging impressive shows of acrobatic unarmed fighting techniques in the villages.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_180;Those guys are fast as lightning!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_180;They had better not teach those things to my peasants.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_RoI_245;I think I know who it was...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_190;A strange man has approached you, seeking audience with you. He claims he is an 'engineer' and he wishes to build a boat that can travel under water and sail it up the Indus. All he needs is a sponsor for the project. If you help him, he will name the boat after you - 'a you-boat', he jokes, smiling nervously.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_190;Interesting. How much money do you need?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_190;You-boat?' Get out. Now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_191;The 'engineer' spent many days building his underwater boat. In the end it was finished and he set out, submerging the craft to the sound of amazed murmuring from the great crowd gathered along the shore. A faint trail of bubbles could be seen as the boat navigated underwater up the river.\nAlas, he was never seen nor heard of again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_191;Hmm, what have we learned from this?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_193;It is rumored that a sacred yogi has mastered the art of levitation, and that he can be seen at a marketplace nearby.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_193;I must see this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_193;I have no time for superstitions.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_194;You arrive at the marketplace. There is a large crowd gathered around the yogi. He does indeed seem to be levitating above the ground, eyes closed. Someone mutters that he has been still like that for several hours.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_194;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_194;Fascinating! I must donate money to this holy man.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_RoI_194;Let's poke him and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_RoI_194;I think I'll give him a hard shove.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_195;You leave the levitating yogi, pondering the magical mysteries of these holy men.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_195;The world holds so many fantastic things.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_196;You poke the yogi. He blinks, then regains his composure.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_196;Poke him again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_196;Leave him alone.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_RoI_196;Give him a good shove.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_197;The yogi opens his eyes, irritated. He steps down and leaves without a word. The rest of the crowd eyes you with disapproval.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_197;What?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_198;You take step back, then throw yourself forward, giving the yogi a forceful shove. He topples over with a frightened screech, hitting his head on the ground. The crowd stares in stunned silence at you and the yogi.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_198;I knew he was a fake!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_158;An elephant has gone crazy and is running amuck in the town outside the castle. It has already killed several people - what shall we do?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_158;Send soldiers to kill it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_158;Try to capture it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_159;Several soldiers were severely injured, but they managed to kill the elephant. The animal died screaming, spilling a whole river of blood all over the street. The peasants are very upset.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_159;Well, at least the town is safe now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_160;The soldiers managed to lure the elephant to a safe area and then kill it with spears.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_160;Ah, good.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_161;It was impossible to capture the crazed beast. It killed several more people, flattened a couple of buildings and then ran off into the countryside.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_161;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_162;A couple of veteran elephant handlers managed to snare and capture the elephant. It has been brought safely to the pens.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_162;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_400;It seems that my interest in the Indian religions has come to the attention of one of their practitioners within the realm. We met and have had the most fruitful discussions about theology and other matters.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_400;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_401;You have received a visitor - an emissary from the famous university at Nalanda. He tells of you of the research and other work they do there and offers you a formal invitation to visit and see this marvel of Bihar.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_401;Interesting - I will accept the invitation.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_401;I don't have the time.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_RoI_402;Nalanda;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_RoI_402;You have arrived at the magnificent University of Nalanda. It's a massive complex of red brick buildings, busy with a bustle of scholars and monks. You have been told that people come here from all over India and beyond in order to study and exchange ideas. The library has a huge amount of texts in every language known to man.\n\nIt's an impresssive place. You don't have much time to spend here, however, so you need to decide what to do...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_RoI_402;I will focus on studying the architecture.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_RoI_402;I think I will spend a few days in the library.;;;;;;;;;x
