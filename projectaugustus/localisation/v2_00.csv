EVTDESC_SoA_5027;You look out across the beautiful valley stretching out before you. It would be a wonderful moment, if not for the fact that there should be no valley here. You are a pilgrim in an unfamiliar land and you have no idea where you are.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5027;If only I hadn't listened to those useless peasants that gave me directions.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5027;If only I'd listened more to those peasants that gave me directions.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5028;Deep in the night...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5028;Sleeping at the pilgrim's inn, you dream a beautiful dream. You are walking through a dense wood, filled with the wonderful sounds and smells of nature. Little squirrels run across your path and birds sing in the trees. You keep walking through the wood, and then you notice a new and strange but familiar smell. You can't quite put your finger on what it is, though. Hmm, it's something you should know, something important... Hmm... yes, it's... it's... it's fire! You are instantly wide awake. The room is hot, you can hear the sound of crackling flames and a moment later you also hear people screaming. Indeed, the inn is on fire!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5028;Help put it out!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5028;Save yourself and let others handle it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5029;They said this was a lawless stretch of road, but you still feel rather unlucky to be in this situation. The robbers are many and armed, and they demand that you pay a 'toll' before you are allowed to pass.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5029;Pay up.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5029;Give these scoundrels the only thing they deserve  steel!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5030;The old wooden bridge has carried many pilgrims in its day. It creaks suspiciously as you step on it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5030;No time to stop, I'm sure it'll hold.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5030;Stop and help repair it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5030;These people deserve a stone bridge. I shall pay for it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5031;You lay awake at night reflecting on your pilgrimage. It's an inner journey as well as a physical one, but can you be sure of which destination it will take you to? And do you even want to have that certainty?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5031;The mind wanders where it will.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5031;It's all right there on the map. Time to get some sleep!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5032;Travelling down a long and lonesome road, you come upon a man lying in a ditch. He seems to have been robbed and beaten up quite badly.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5032;Bind up his wounds, help him to an inn and pay for his recovery.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5032;Leave him, he's probably dead anyway.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5033;The flood;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5033;There have been strong rains in the area lately, and the valley that you need to cross has been transformed into a sizeable lake. The water is still rising, so you start to build a large raft in order to cross. When you're almost finished building it, a group of farmers show up and explain that they also need to cross the valley in order to get back to their homes. They bring with them a number of animals that they've rescued from the flood.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5033;I'm not sharing my raft with anyone, man or beast.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5033;Bring the farmers with all their animals.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5033;Only let them bring the cats and dogs.;;;;;;;;;x 
noahs_ark_cats_dogs;It had better not rain any more.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5034;At your camp at night, a large group of fellow pilgrims appear. They have travelled far and are hungry and out of food. You look through your supplies, but you have only just over half a dozen loaves of bread and a few fishes.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5034;Share it around, it's more filling than it looks.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5034;Sorry, there's not enough for everyone.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5035;You have spent the last fews days of your journey on water. The vessel you are travelling on rocks gently in the breeze, as the sailors go about their business. Being on board ship is quite unlike being on land  so much is different, so many strange words for all the things here. Starboard? Abaft? Aground? What does it all mean?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5035;This is fascinating. I must take the opportunity to learn.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5035;This does not concern me. I will spend my time in prayer.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5036;As you stop to make camp near a river crossing along with other pilgrims, you observe a group of builders working on a new bridge just upstream. You walk up to them and see that the arches of the bridge are already half completed. The master builder notices your interest and walks up to you and offers to tell you about the construction techniques they are using.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5036;Yes, tell me more about this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5036;Nobles build castles. This is for peasants.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5037;The journey is long and hard. Your feet are sore, and your back as well. Far from the castle kitchens the food is barely edible, and on top of that you seem to feel cold all the time. Perhaps you were not quite cut out for this pilgrimage thing?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5037;My faith will see me through.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5037;Maybe this was a bad idea. I'll stay and rest for a while.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5038;As you pass through a small village along the pilgrim's path, an old woman comes up to you. She has recognized you as a pilgrim and explains that her daughter and her family live close to your destination. They are suffering hard times and she asks you to bring them a large purse of money.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5038;Of course I will help you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5038;Of course I will help you (secretly add some money of your own).;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5038;Of course I will help you (lie and keep the money for yourself).;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_SoA_5038;This is not my business, old crone.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5039;There is a star shining unusually bright in the clear sky. You see it every night, and its position coincides more or less with the direction to the destination of your pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5039;The Lord is showing me the way.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5039;It's a bright star, so what?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5045;Riders approach...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5045;Thundering hooves are heard down the road. The pilgrims look with apprehension at the rising dust cloud. As the riders close, steel armour and steel-tipped lances reflect the bright sunlight. The tension rises, but then a collective sigh of relief is heard as the banner of the holy knights is seen flying above the mass of armored men. The knights halt before the pilgrims and graciously offer to accompany you on the road.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5045;Praised be [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]! A most welcome escort!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5045;Never trust armed men who appear out of nowhere.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5046;As the evening approaches after a long day on the road, you come upon several campfires. Around the fires you find a group of holy knights, resting after a long day's ride. They invite you to share their meal and trade stories.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5046;Discuss theology with the knights.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5046;Trade stories of war.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5047;During the last couple of days, you have made company on the road with a holy knight on his way to the same destination. You have lively and interesting conversations, and you find that you have many things in common.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5047;How unexpected, to make a new friend this far from home.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5047;I have no need for friends.;;;;;;;;;x 
gain_friend;[Root.GetTitledName] gains a new friend.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5087;You have made friends with [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5087;Great!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5050;Canterbury;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5050;You have finally arrived at Canterbury! It is beautifully situated on the river Stour in Kent in southeast England. The town itself and the surrounding meadows are full of pilgrims from all over Europe. You start to make your way through the hustle and bustle, eager to see the famous cathedral and contemplate the tomb of the martyr Thomas Becket, who was viciously murdered inside the cathedral itself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5050;A green and pleasant land!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5051;Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5051;You have finally arrived at Jerusalem! Passing by the Mount of Olives, you enter through the city gate and are immediately overcome by a feeling of having made a truly epic journey. The city is filled with people of all creeds and colors, the air heavy with smells of strange spices and foreign plants. You make your way through the throng of people and animals, excited by the knowledge that you are now close to the Via Dolorosa and the other holy places. You plan to also visit the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, but first of all you need to find someplace to stay. After all, you wouldn't want to be forced to sleep in a stable, would you?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5051;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5052;Köln;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5052;You have finally arrived at Köln! The mighty cathedral housing the relics of the Three Kings is still under construction, but it is an impressive structure nonetheless. The city itself lies on the mighty river Rhine, and busy commerce mingles with the flow of pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5052;I will pray at the Shrine of the Three Kings!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5053;Rome;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5053;You have finally arrived at Rome! As you enter the Eternal City, you are struck by the many ancient buildings and monuments that you pass by. It is truly impressive, and you try to imagine how the apostles felt when they first came here on their holy mission at a time when the city's power was at its peak. Though large areas seem to be depopulated, the city still boasts an impressive population concentrated around the Tiber river. The holy sites you want to visit are primarily the basilicas of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, as well as other early churches and places connected to the martyrs. You start making your way to the center of the city, hoping that you won't get lost in traffic as the crowds start to get more dense.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5053;A thousand roads lead men forever to Rome!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5054;Santiago;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5054;You have finally arrived at Santiago, the oldest major pilgrimage site in the West. It is an inland town close to the Atlantic Ocean, with origins going back at least to the Roman Empire. The fabled Way of Saint James is a long road to travel, and you have passed through many towns and villages on your way here.\n\nThe legend holds that as Saint James' remains were brought here by ship from Jerusalem, they were lost at sea due to a storm. But soon after they were miraculously washed ashore, covered in scallops. Because of this, scallop shells have become a popular souvenir among pilgrims.\n\nYour mind dwells on the legends of this holy place,  as you make your way through the crowds towards the center of town.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5054;I must remember to bring a seashell home with me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5097;Constantinople;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5097;You have finally arrived at Constantinople! The city is enormous, dwarfing all other cities that you've seen. There is a bustle of people, commerce, sounds and smells that overpower your senses and leave you quite dizzy. As you make your way through the streets in order to find a place to stay, you are impressed by scale and number of the ancient churches and monuments that appear everywhere along your path.\n\nYou press on through the crowds, eager to finally look upon such fabled churches as the Hagia Sofia and the Saint George.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5097;Ah, the City of Constantine!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5098;Aksum;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5098;You have finally arrived at Aksum! This is one of the oldest centers of the Christian faith, and it is here that the Ark of the Covenant is kept, guarded by monks inside the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. Though no longer the great city it once was, Aksum is still an important center of pilgrimage, and you can see many travellers in the streets.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5098;It is beautiful, ancient Aksum!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5099;Antioch;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5099;You have finally arrived at Antioch! This is the oldest city of Christianity, the first place where people actually began to call themselves 'Christian'. Saint Peter and Saint Paul both worked here, as did Saint Ignatius. It is a place where early Christendom was formed and defined, and it later expanded from here, westwards, to Rome and beyond.\n\nAs your feet tread the ancient streets of Antioch, you can feel the history and tradition in the air around you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5099;A great and ancient city!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5056;As you walk around on this holy ground, you ponder the secrets and the essence of God. The teachings of the holy church have never felt more relevant to you than now. Imagine the knowledge contained in the scriptures stored here!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5056;The way to Heaven is through study.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5056;No, I shall spend my time praying.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5057;The saints, this holy ground, how it all moves my soul! I realize now that all my life up to this point has only been a preparation for this journey. How wondrous that the light of the Lord truly shines in me, a poor sinner. From now on I shall always do His work.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5057;Praise [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5058;Traveling all this way to see the holy places, you had hoped for more than this. It's just lots of people, some churches and a few bones that really look quite suspicious. Before coming, you had read the exalted stories of other pilgrims, but this just isn't like they described it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5058;That's it?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5059;As you approach the holy temple, you overhear a theological discussion between several priests. You stop and eagerly engage them in conversation, expanding upon several of your favorite topics. They are very impressed by your knowledge and invite you to hold a lecture for a group of assembled religious scholars.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5059;I will be most pleased to share my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5060;The bustling mass of pilgrims is impressive, as are the many languages, colors and ways of dress present. People come here from west, east, north and south. You are standing at a place where the roads meet, and that is where people and ideas meet.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5060;Take the opportunity to observe different languages and customs.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5060;Take the opportunity to meet new people.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5061;The stories of other pilgrims all spoke of how impressive this place is. Now that you can see it with your own eyes, you can only join in their praise. You are glad that you came here, to one of Christianity's holiest places.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5061;It was well worth the journey!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5062;So far from home, all alone, and so many lovely people in the same situation as me. It's a great opportunity for some fun, isn't it?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5062;What's the harm?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5062;That's not what I'm here for.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5063;This holy place is bustling with pilgrims from all over the world, and a myriad of accents and languages mingle in the parks and plazas. In this great cultural melting pot, should there not also be room for me to express who I really am?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5063;The folks at home will never know.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5063;No, it's a sin!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5064;The healers;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5064;Near the holy sites, you hear rumors of a group of monks with strange cures for diseases. Eagerly, you seek them out, hoping against hope that they may aid you. Once in their care you are fed strange potions, foods and herbs. You are unconscious or delirious during most of the process and remember few details, but at last you wake up to find that you have been miraculously healed of your ills.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5064;God's hand touched me and healed me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5064;These monks really know their stuff.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5064;I must learn more of this secret magic.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5065;All these magnificent temples built in your honor! Oh the glory! And all these pilgrims - finally you may revel in their adulation. Perhaps you should reveal yourself to the masses who have come to worship you?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5065;Speak to them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5065;No, I shall enjoy this glorious time in silence.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5066;You have come to visit the holy sites and show your devotion. But surely, there is no harm in having a little fun first?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5066;To the tavern!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5066;No... must control... myself...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5067;Jerusalem, what a fascinating place! A holy place for three great religions, and the city and surrounding area are full of monuments giving tribute to God. Somehow when you look closer, they don't seem all that different. It rather makes you think, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5067;Muhammad was a great thinker.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5067;Jesus was a Jew, wasn't he?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5080;Blasphemous fools! Do they not know their Lord? How dare they throw you out of your own temple?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5080;I shall have my vengeance.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5091;You have finally returned from your pilgrimage. It was a rewarding and interesting journey, and you'd do it all again if you could. Still, it's good to be back home.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5091;A great experience!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5092;You have finally returned from your pilgrimage. It didn't turn out quite as expected, and perhaps you shouldn't have gone there in the first place. But there's no changing it now, at least you're home again and can start forgetting about it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5092;I won't tell my family what really happened out there.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5093;You have finally returned from your pilgrimage. Though the insolent rats did not recognize you or pay you proper homage, it was still an enlightening experience. Now there is plenty of time to prepare the day of reckoning.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5093;They will pay for worshipping false idols.;;;;;;;;;x

[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] was found lifeless in [From.GetPossPronoun] bed, face frozen in a terrible grimace, with a trickle of blood running down [From.GetPossPronoun] cheek. The physicians can find nothing wrong with the body. It's as if [From.GetSubjectPronoun] had died of fright from a terrible nightmare. There are dark rumours about the so called 'demon child', my [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], again... As always when something terrible happens, [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] does seem inordinately happy.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_SOA_3040;Lethal Nightmares;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SOA_3040;My beloved [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] claims that some... thing tried to kill [From.GetObjectPronoun] last night. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] woke up with a small shape pressing down on [From.GetPossPronoun] chest. It ran off hissing, but left a nasty long needle behind. I think it was just a nightmare - the maids leave needles lying around everywhere. However, there are dark rumours about the so called 'demon child', my [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], again...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOA_3041;My dear [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] must have suffered a stroke in [From.GetPossPronoun] sleep last night. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] was found drooling in bed, one eye bloodshot, mumbling about a small monster that stabbed [From.GetObjectPronoun] in the eye before it ran off. There are dark rumours about the so called 'demon child', my [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], again...

EVTDESC_SOA_3061;My prisoner, the depraved [From.GetTitledName], who is rumored to be the spawn of [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], has somehow escaped my dungeons! The guards have no explanation - the cell was still locked, but empty.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOA_3061;These are dark tidings...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SOA_3065;A well equipped army of cultists, followers of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], has arrived in [Root.Location.GetName] led by three powerful witches. They stand ready to serve me and our dread master in this important war.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOA_3071;My [GetFromRelation], little [From.GetFirstName], has really taken to [From.GetPossPronoun] nanny - a remarkably talented young woman, learned as any [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]. It is strange though... I have no idea when this girl showed up or where she came from, exactly.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOA_3071;She really is most impressive;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOA_3077;During a nice family outing by the river, everyone suddenly noticed the talented nanny [From.GetFirstName] standing on top of the old tower. Smiling and looking straight at my little [GetFromFromRelation], she cried out 'I love you [FromFrom.GetFirstName]!' and calmly took a step forward into empty air, falling to the ground with black clothes flapping like the wings of some huge crow. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] laughed delightedly at the loud thump, clapping [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] hands as everyone else stared in utter shock and disbelief.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_SoA_5307;The Cadaver Synod;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5307;You have received strange news from Rome. The former Pope, [From.GetTitledFirstName], did by his actions and lifestyle so defile the Holy See that the current authorities in Rome decided to put his corpse on trial!\nThe corpse of [From.GetTitledFirstName] was removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgement. It was propped up on a throne, and a deacon was chosen to speak for it as its legal representative.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the accused was found guilty on all accounts and subjected to a punishment most dire. The corpse was stripped of its papal vestments, three fingers on the right hand (those used to give blessings) were cut off, and then it was interred in a graveyard normally reserved for foreigners of low status. The punishment still not being deemed severe enough, the corpse was then exhumed again, tied to weights and cast into the river Tiber.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5307;I am sure the judges have acted wisely.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_SoA_5341;A visitor;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5341;You have received a visitor, a monk from the famous great abbey at Cluny. He tells you that the monks there spend much of their days in devoted prayer, and that they always mention the names of the most pious Christians in those prayers.\n\nIf you would demonstrate your immense piety by donating a large sum of gold to Cluny Abbey, you would surely be among those present in the monks' prayers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5341;They shall have my support!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5341;I'm sure they'll manage anyway.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5342;An invitation;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5342;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have received an invitation to visit the great monastery at Cluny!\n\nIt could make for a most interesting journey. Cluny Abbey has grown to great prominence and power since it was given independence by the Duke of Burgundy in 910. Subject now only to the Pope and supported by extensive lands as well as generous donations, it is a great center of wealth and learning. The Abbey's church is the largest in Europe, not even the great cathedrals in Rome or Constantinople can match it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5342;A wonderful opportunity!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5342;Tell them I can't come.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5343;Cluny Abbey;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5343;So this is the famous Cluny Abbey! The great church towers majestically over an extensive complex of buildings. The surrounding farmlands are rich and fertile, with peasants toiling to bring the fruits of the land into the coffers of the monastery. You can see many monks moving about and a also spot a nun or two. You can sense the atmosphere of learning, piety and power. This is a place that enjoys the direct support of kings and powerful nobles, not to mention the Pope.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5343;I must study the magnificent architecture here!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5343;May I see the library?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5343;These monks obviously eat well...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_SoA_5343;I have come here to pray.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5219;The abbot of a nearby monastery has asked that you make a donation towards the repairs of the monastery church. Surely, it wouldn't hurt to ensure that you are in the monks' prayers?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5219;God will know that I support the church.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_SoA_5353;[FromFrom.GetFirstName], the Maid of [From.GetName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5353;My [Root.GetLordLady], there are strange tidings from the province of [From.GetName]. As our country suffers under the strain of war, a young woman has come forward and declared that the Lord has spoken to her and instructed her to deliver us from the enemies of our land. She wears armour, wields a sword and rides with the soldiers. Her name is [FromFrom.GetFullName] and she is said to be approaching your court at this very moment to offer her services to you as a leader in the war.\n\nSurely, it's an absurd notion that a young peasant woman should take the role of marshal or general of the [Root.GetTitle]'s armies?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5353;Let us receive her and see what she can do for us.;;;;;;;;;x 
jeanne_arrives_message;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] the Maid of [From.GetName] has arrived at the court of [Root.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5355;[From.GetFirstName]  the nobles react;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5355;My [Root.GetTitle], the lords of the Realm complain. They think it most unfitting and strange that a young maid of low birth is allowed such a prominent position when there are noble lords aplenty who are much more well prepared and competent to lead your armies. Some of them are asking if you are doing this deliberately to insult them.\n\nThere is also the issue of her claiming to be personally sent by God - it sounds rather heretical.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5355;Let them moan. I am the [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5355;I agree, but this woman is popular among the common folk.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5355;Very well, we shall put her on trial for heresy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5357;[From.GetFirstName] and the [Root.GetTitle];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5357;One evening at court, [From.GetFirstName] approaches you and asks to speak with you in private. You agree and the both of you sit down for a talk in your chambers. [From.GetFirstName] speaks to you of her visions of Christ and her quest to save the country from the enemy. She speaks with passion, her simple honesty and forceful zeal both coming across as she looks you in the eyes. She declares her fierce loyalty and love for you as the chosen [Root.GetTitle]. You are quite impressed by her passion, intelligence and sincerity.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5357;Thank you for coming to see me, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5357;My dearest [From.GetFirstName], you are truly sent by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5357;We both know you are a powerhungry impostor, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_SoA_5357;Love, you say? Come sit over here...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5358;The Mission;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5358;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] looks at you seriously. 'I hope you have been listening, my [Root.GetLordLady]. The country is hurting and you, its rightful sovereign, is the one to mend it. I shall aid you, this is the mission I have been given by our Lord Christ.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5358;Very good.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5359;Zeal;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5359;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] looks at you with tears of joyous fervour in her eyes. 'My [Root.GetLordLady], you are the highest and also the wisest [Root.GetManWoman] in the realm. God shall guide you through me, and the people shall be saved. With the sword of righteousness in my hand, guided by your wisdom and the will of God, we will be victorious!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5359;So it shall be!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5360;Mistrust;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5360;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] stands up, a shocked and bewildered expression or her face. 'My [Root.GetLordLady], your accusation wounds me most deeply! I have heard evil things said of me, but did not think I would hear it from you. Still, my loyalty to you comes from Christ and He is stronger than the Devil who has corrupted your faith. I shall always remain your servant, my [Root.GetLordLady]'.\n\nWith these last words, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] kneels before you, tears of sorrow streaming down her face.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5360;Stop this ridiculous charade, woman.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5361;The Lovers;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5361;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] quietly sits down next to you and looks into your eyes. As you embrace her and kiss her, she shudders and whispers: 'My Lord, see how my hands tremble at your touch. Just as I felt this immense joy mixed with bewilderment when Christ first spoke to me, so do I now feel my blood rushing in the same way in your presence. It seems to me that it is the will of God that we shall be together.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5361;Come to my bedchamber then, [FromFrom.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5362;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] the Chaste;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5362;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] recoils away from your advances, her eyes expressing surprise, sorrow and anger as she looks at you. 'My Lord, I did not think the devil would have sown such dark seeds in you as to try and impose on my chastity! I belong to Christ and to no man. Rest assured, my Lord - my loyalty to you is untouched, but so shall my body also remain, lest it be the touch of cold steel and martyrdom.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5362;I see.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5364;[From.GetFirstName] and the common folk;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5364;The entire country is boiling with rumours and gossip of [From.GetFullName], the humble country girl who rose to become a trusted servant of the [Root.GetTitle]. Hope of defeating the realm's enemies is blossoming, and peasants everywhere are celebrating this fantastic tale of a virgin saviour from the humblest ranks of society.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5364;She is truly a legend in her own time!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5366;[From.GetFirstName] requests an audience;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5366;[From.GetFirstName] has come before you asking to speak to you at the council. She says that the military establishment seems trapped in old doctrines and that the commanders would benefit from more offensive thinking, as well as more religious schooling, of course.\n\nThere is grumbling from some of the assembled nobles at her speech.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5366;Thank you, [From.GetFirstName], that's a good idea.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5366;When I need your advice, I'll ask for it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5366;I've had enough of this insolence  arrest her!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5368;[From.GetFirstName] and the Church;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5368;Your [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName] approaches you one morning for a candid conversation: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], there is much displeasure among the clergy at the elevation of this young woman, [From.GetFirstName]. The things she says are considered heretical by some in the Holy Church, and others, frankly, see their positions threatened by one of such low birth and meager schooling gaining so much prestige. I would advise you to consider whether it is worth protecting this young lass at so great a potential cost.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5368;Please remind these clergymen who is [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5368;She is merely a tool, the Church has nothing to fear.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5368;Very well, we will put her on trial and see if she is a heretic.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5370;The influence of [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5370;These are unusual times. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence is felt all around, wherever you go. There is a surge in religiosity among the commoners, who see her as a national saviour and almost a Christ-figure. Among the nobles many are charmed by her pious innocence and energetic zeal, in spite of most of them also viewing her as a dangerous upstart. Meanwhile, the clergy is divided, some seeing a heretic and others a saint.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5370;We should all try to be more like her.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5370;I dislike fanatics, but I will suffer her for now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5373;A common girl from [From.GetName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5373;Your [Root.GetChancellorName] [Root.job_chancellor.GetFullName] comes to see you, a look of worry on [Root.job_chancellor.GetHerHis] face. [Root.job_chancellor.GetSheHe] explains that there are increased grumblings among the nobles regarding the position of your protegé [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. Many of them refuse to accept that a lowborn woman from [From.GetName], however competent and pious, be continuously given so many privileges normally reserved for nobility. It sets a bad example for the peasants and may cause unrest, they fear. There have also been numerous incidents of perceived insults and scandals of protocol between [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and various prestigious army commanders.\n\nIt seems many nobles feel they have suffered her too long, and some still entertain the idea of demanding her arrest and trial for heresy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5373;Bah! Their own incompetence makes them envious.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5373;I shall force her to speak more humbly henceforth.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_SoA_5373;Not noble enough? Bring her before me and I shall knight her!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_SoA_5373;I cannot abide this any longer. Put her in chains!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5382;[From.GetFirstName] marries;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5382;Never has the realm seen so much attention focused on the wedding of one who is not of noble birth. The wedding of [From.GetFirstName] has caused ringing of churchbells and impromptu feasts and prayers among the common folk all around the country.\n\nNo longer a maid perhaps, but an icon of the realm still, and even the [Root.GetTitle] should make sure to make a public toast to the newly-weds.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5382;Indeed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5385;[From.GetFirstName] the mother;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5385;[From.GetFirstName] the Maid she used to be, but no longer. Some of her followers speak of a virgin birth, though such talk is frowned upon by the Church. The image of [From.GetFirstName] has now changed in the eyes of many, but she continues to be a focus of adulation, and very soon after the birth she has once again taken up her sword and saddled her horse.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5385;So strong!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5391;The trial of [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5391;[From.GetFirstName] has been put on trial for heresy. She claims to be sent by Christ, to be his messenger. She is accused of being sent by the devil, and of claiming to be God's daughter, and of sinning by wearing men's attire, among other things. The judges come mostly from the clergy, and they begin a hard line of questioning against the young woman. There is unrest outside the castle where the trial is held, as many followers have come to pray for her and express their belief in her innocence. This trial seems set to last for a while.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5391;The truth shall be our only concern.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5392;The trial of [From.GetFirstName]  judgement;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5392;[From.GetFirstName] has been put through long sessions of questioning for over a month now. After much deliberation on the law and theology and evaluation of testimony the case still seems unclear to many. It all seems to come down to whether you want to believe that she is a messenger of God or of the Devil. Or perhaps it's more down to whether it is politically expedient to convict her or not. Young [From.GetFirstName] herself has assumed a position of sorrowful fatalism. She says she has seen her fate in a vision and that she knows what is to come.\nThe crowds surrounding the trial all await the verdict with tension. If [From.GetFirstName] were to be aquitted, the humiliation of the trial itself surely signifies that she has fallen from royal grace and will never come back to hold the position she once did. But in the case of a conviction, a gruesome death by burning at the stake is certain to be the fate that awaits her. There is little mercy for heretics.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5392;She is guilty.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5392;She is innocent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5394;The execution of [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5394;The flames leap higher and higher, crackling as they begin to eat at the wood. Slowly, [From.GetFirstName] starts to twist as they begin to lick her legs. The gathered crowd stares in stunned silence - some hungry for her death, others overcome by horror at what they see. The life of this woman is coming to an end, she who captured the attention of the entire realm during these months. Saint or devil  the eyes of the onlookers hold different views, but it seems certain that she will remembered for many many years. Perhaps she shall have her restitution in time, perhaps not.\nAs the flames climb higher and take hold of [From.GetFirstName]'s body, she twitches violently but still does not cry out. Her gaze is fixed on the heavens, tears streaming from her face. Many onlookers turn away now, but others are fixed to the spot, unable to avert their eyes. Slowly, [From.GetFirstName] disappears from view as the flames rise around her.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5394;May the Lord have mercy on her soul.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5395;[From.GetFirstName] is aquitted;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5395;The aquittal of [From.GetFirstName] have left mixed reactions across the realm. There are celebrations among the peasants, and more mixed reactions among the nobility and clergy. [From.GetFirstName] herself spends these days in prayer. She realizes that she will not lead armies again nor enjoy the ear of the [Root.GetTitle] as before. Still, the aquittal at the trial has vindicated her words and actions and she seems at peace. No longer on the grand stage of war and politics, she seems now content to spend the rest of her days living as a nun.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5395;You are safe now, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5398;Years later...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5398;After the first turbulent years, it seems everyone in the country has gotten used to [FromFrom.GetFullName]. Some appreciate her and some do not, but the more violent controversy and commotion has died out and people are now preoccupied with other matters. She lives on, although the tales of the early years of the Maid of [From.GetName] are already the stuff of legend.;;;;;;;;;x

At long last, this position has been filled and the High Priesthood reconstituted.\n\nLike the Jewish priests of ancient times, the Kohen Gadol was traditionally required to be a descendant of Aaron, the older brother of Moses. Due to a lack of suitable candidates this requirement has been waived, but the new High Priest still enjoys the respect of the Jewish religious communities, and the Priesthood has moved into and established itself at the Third Temple.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_SoA_5401;The Shepherds' Crusade;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5401;A combination of economic stress and religious fervor caused by the current crusade has led to considerable unrest among the peasants. A strange elderly monk known calling himself The Master of Hungary has been criticizing the religious establishment and preaching a 'Shepherds' Crusade' to the common folk. He has already been able to gather a huge following, an army of shepherds as it were, and they have been assaulting priests and killing Jews all over the country. Needless to say, the church is not amused. There is now talk among this rabble of marching on the capital to seek the support of the [Root.GetTitle] - who knows where this will end?;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_SoA_5345;A visitor;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5345;You have received a visitor, a monk from one of the monasteries on the fabled Mount Athos on the Chalkidiki peninsula in Greece. He tells you that the monks are constantly expanding their presence and constructing new monasteries at this most holy site. However, building for the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] requires earthly funds, he explains, and this is why he has come to see you.\n\nIf you would demonstrate your piety by donating a large sum of gold to the monasteries on Mount Athos, it would surely become known all over the land that you have done so, and you would of course also be mentioned in the monks' daily prayers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5345;Of course they shall have my support!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_SoA_5345;I can't spare the funds right now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_SoA_5346;An invitation;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_SoA_5346;My Lord, we have received an invitation to visit the holy monasteries on Mount Athos! The monks there are very protective of their domain, and it such an invitation is surely testament to your exalted status among men.\n\nIt is said that Mount Athos' status as a holy place began when it was first visited by the Virgin Mary, who loved it so that she asked her Son to make it her personal garden. And so it was, the mountain and the peninsula were consecrated as the Garden of the Mother of God. Because of this, all other women are forbidden to tread on its sacred ground. Monks, however, have been living here for hundreds of years, and more and more monasteries are constructed in the area as time goes by.;;;;;;;;;x

This is truly a strange and wondrous place!\n\nYou have a few days to spend here, and you hope to make the most of your visit.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SoA_5347;I must see all the monasteries, the architecture here is fascinating!;;;;;;;;;x
