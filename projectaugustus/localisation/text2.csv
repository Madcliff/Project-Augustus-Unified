EVTDESC3693;It was a great day for falconing, the sky was blue and the game was plentiful. My child [From.GetTitledFirstName], although maybe a bit unused to having to gut and skin the hunted prey, did very good and [From.GetSheHe] did not complain once.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3693;I think it was good for both of us to do this together;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3694;[From.GetTitledFirstName] refused to gut and skin the hunted prey the falcon brought, and it was pure luck my huntsman managed to grab the bird when [From.GetSheHe] panicked and let go of the tethers when the bird tried to fly off. The day went from bad to worse and I was not very happy when we got back home.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3694;This was shameful! How could you disappoint me like this?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3695;The wager [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I agreed on was that the one who managed to catch the most prey wouldn't need to gut and skin any of it. I lost and, although I usually would rather not spend a whole hour gutting and skinning hares, this time I was too proud of [From.GetTitledFirstName] to really care about the slimy, gut-wrenching feel of intestines sliding through my hands...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3695;I am impressed! No one has ever killed so many hares!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC3696;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was more interested in flowers and herbs than the prey the birds hunted. When it was time to skin and gut the hares [From.GetHerHis] face literally went green and we had to stand back when [From.GetSheHe] lost [From.GetHerHis] lunch.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA3696;[From.GetTitledFirstName], you have to get used to this!;;;;;;;;;x

He demanded that I would do something about 'those Merry Men in green'.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10002;Give him some gold and send him away;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10002;This is outrageous!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10003;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10003;My sheriff and I discussed what we should do about the outlaws and came up with two ideas. Every man and woman who had been harassed by the bandits, including the sheriff, have been told about the leader's skill with the bow. An archery contest might lure him out of his beloved forest. Another option would be to use a disguise to find the villain and bring them to court.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10003;Too risky;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10003;An archery contest, of course!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10010;An archery contest will be held;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC10003;A clever disguise should work;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10010;Archery Contest;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10010;The day was perfect for an archery contest. The sun hid between clouds, a small breeze cooled the nervous and everyone seemed happy. The targets were set and ready, all that was needed now was my signal.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10010;Let the contest... BEGIN!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10011;Let us see who we capture!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10012;This might not work;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10011;The green-clad stranger;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10011;Over there! Yes, there! That's him alright. What do we do now?' The sheriff pointed at a man clad in green with a great bow in his hands. I watched him as he won effortlessly against every person foolish enough to try and match their skill against his. The man's skill with his great bow amazed me. 'This man is a great archer, too bad he's a lawless poacher living off my venison.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10011;Arrest and hang him!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10011;Perhaps I could hire him and his Merry Men as gamekeepers;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10012;The Old Man;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10012;The other contestants and I laughed hard as the old man tried to draw the bow with shaking hands. After several attempts, he finally succeeded. He closed one of his runny eyes and THUD!... It hit the bullseye. Everyone's chin hit the ground as the old man defeated his contestants one by one. The poacher we had set the trap for was nowhere to be seen, so I had to grumpily give the old man his admittedly well-earned prize: a golden arrow.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10012;What happened?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10013;The archery contest was a success and a failure;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10013;That didn't work;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10013;Frustration swept through my veins as the archery contest proved unsuccessful in luring and trapping the elusive poacher. Perhaps we should try something else?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10013;Leave him and his gang alone;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10013;A smelly peasant should not arouse their suspicion;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10020;A Devil in Disguise;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10020;Devil in Disguise;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10020;I removed my beautiful fur-lined cloaks and reluctantly eased myself into a peasant's stinking clothes. A woolen tunic, a small hat and muddy boots completed my disguise. Now, me own ma wouldn't even recognize me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10020;Let's see how this works...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10020;Is this really befitting a [Root.GetTitle]?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10021;Disguise revealed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10022;Stumbles upon the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10023;A stranger in green;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10021;Disguise revealed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10021;I had not even taken one step into the great forest before an arrow burrowed itself into the ground just in front of my toes. I froze for a short second before I started struggling to get my sword out of its hiding place. When I had finally freed my sword, a man clad in green stood before me. He held the greatest bow I ever seen with an arrow on its string aimed at me. 'Leave', he said and I obeyed immediately. Behind me, the forest echoed with thunderous laughter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10021;Blast!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10022;Meet the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10022;My stomach growled louder than the wolves howling in the distance. My search for the lawless men had taken me farther into the forest than I had imagined it would. Just a couple of hours had passed since I broke my fast but it felt like days. I kept walking and reached a small brook. As I bent down for a drink, I heard laughter and faint voices of many people coming towards me. Before I could hide, they were upon me. After a thorough interrogation where I pretended to be naïve or downright stupid, they allowed me to follow them to their camp.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10022;H-hello...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10022;I'll run away now, bye!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10030;Meet the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10023;A stranger in green;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10023;My bad mood did not improve when I arrived at a small bridge across a shallow creek and a man large in stature demanded that I pay a toll to cross the bridge. I laughed in his face and he challenged me, even though I bore a sword and he nothing but a wooden staff.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10023;Easy as pie!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10024;You win the fight;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10025;You lose the fight;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10026;Your real identity is revealed;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10023;If I promise to never return, will you let me go then?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10024;A stranger defeated;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10024;It did not seem fair to fight the man with a sword when he had a wooden staff, so I carved myself a staff before we commenced. After receiving several blows, I dodged his attack and drove the tip of my staff into his left side and as he doubled up, I hit him with all my strength. With a sigh he lost consciousness and fell into the creek. I feared he might drown so I poked at him with my staff. With a roar he exploded out of the river and up on the embankment. He grumpily admitted defeat after some persuasion and with a grimace and a limp he took me to his lawless brothers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10024;As I said, easy as pie!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10025;A stranger victorious;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10025;I carved myself a wooden staff as it did not seem fair to use a sword against a man armed only with a staff. We exchanged blows and he was both stronger and faster than I had thought him to be. He did not seem to tire and when I lowered my staff to admit defeat, he delivered a hard blow that sent me over the bridge and into the muddy water. Roaring with laughter, he helped me get up on the bridge and slapped me so hard I coughed up the last mouthful of water I had swallowed. He insisted I would follow him and meet his gang.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10025;I couldn't say no to him;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10026;A stranger suspicious;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10026;In the heat of battle, I somehow revealed to the green-clad man who I was. I tried to parry his fierce blows but I was too slow. I heard rather than felt the staff smash into my skull. When I woke up my sword, purse and opponent were long gone.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10026;Now I will never catch him, nor the Merry Men!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10030;Meet the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10030;As I approached their hideout, songs, laughter and people talking reached my ears. It was more a small village hiding beneath and up in the trees rather than a lawless gang's lair. Women cooked, tended to children and babbled with the men who practiced their skills with bows and swords. A woman clothed in green and as skilled as any man with a bow caught my eye but before I could approach her, I was introduced to their leader who seemed restless and asked me hundreds of questions. In order to gain their trust, I had to prove myself to him and his gang.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10030;Really?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10031;Steal from the rich and give to the poor;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10030;Let's see what adventure we can find;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10032;Adventure ahead!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC10030;This is enough!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10040;Arrest the leader of the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD10026;This is as far as I dare take it;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10031;Steal from the rich;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10031;Praying he would not recognize me, I stepped out in front of my old friend and demanded he would surrender his purse. The way he looked at me, disgust mixed with fear, could only mean he did not recognize me. I had to threaten to kill him to make him let go of the purse, and I made a silent vow to try and compensate him should I be able to ever return to my castle. His purse was heavy and so was my heart as I returned to the bandit leader.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10031;This has gone too far!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10031;Time to leave;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC10031;Now I know where to find them;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10041;Betray the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10032;Adventure!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10032;I insisted that the leader and I would go looking for adventure together, without any of the other Merry Men. They grumbled a bit but was silenced by the leader who thought it to be an excellent idea. As we walked down the road, we saw a man clad in horse-skin leaning against a tree. I wanted to confront the horse-man myself but the stubborn leader did not listen. While he talked to horse-man, I was attacked and tied to a tree by one of my own sheriffs! The leader of the Merry Men returned, saw me tied to the tree and killed my sheriff before he cut my ropes.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10032;This has gone too far!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10032;Now what?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC10032;This was... fun?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10033;Leave the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD10032;Time to leave and leave them alone;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10033;Leave the Merry Men;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10033;I slunk away from the Merry Men after having had adventures, venison and flirted with the green-clad maid. I had great fun together with the outlaws and feel no need to try and change their ways, as long as their shenanigans do not affect me. They seemed rather harmless, content to hide in their forest and occasionally robbing someone who will not suffer from losing a little gold.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10033;Fare thee well!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10040;Time to make a decision;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10040;What should I do about the green-clad Merry Men and their leader?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10040;I'll hang them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10040;I'll hire them as gamekeepers;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10041;Ambush!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10041;When the snores of the Merry Men echoed throughout the forest, I snuck back home and rallied my troops. I led them straight to the band of robbers and thieves. We caught every one of the bandits, the women and children were spared and set free.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10041;Kill them all!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB10041;If their leader becomes my gamekeeper I will spare their lives;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP10042;The wedding between lady Marion and Robin;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME10042;The Wedding;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC10042;The wedding between lady Marion and Robin was held in the forest, venison was served at the wedding feast but I let it slip, for now. The bridal couple had only eyes for each other and when the fat monk started playing a slow, beautiful song about love they joined hands and danced, still gazing into each other eyes. They did not even notice when the song turned faster and the rest of the dancers followed the rhythm, but continued dancing slowly until the stars started sparkling on the clear sky.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA10042;I wish them good luck with all my heart;;;;;;;;;x
