fp_vault_3;Hidden Chamber;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_mansion_1_desc;This mansion has belonged to this family for generations, and although it may not look very impressive, it has all the comforts of home.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_mansion_2_desc;This mansion is impressive enough to command the respect of the surrounding countryside. It is clearly the home of someone important.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_mansion_3_desc;A palace fit for a king, its shining towers can be seen from a league away on a clear day. Though it may only consist of brick and mortar, it is the beating heart of this entire dynasty.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_mansion_4_desc;Truly, the splendor of this palace would be the envy of a Roman emperor. Its great halls shine of gold and marble, and hundreds of servants scurry through them daily in service of their masters. It is nothing less than a monument to the greatness of this dynasty.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_barracks_1_desc;The dynasty's household guards are lodged within these simple barracks. They are crowded and unsanitary, but provide decent protection against the elements.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_barracks_2_desc;An industrious swordsmith has opened up a forge in the palace courtyard. This will make it easier to equip new recruits with weapons.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_barracks_3_desc;A large armory has been constructed in a corner of the palace courtyard. It holds enough weapons and armor to equip a small army at a moment's notice.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_stable_1_desc;This small stable just outside the palace walls reeks of hay and manure. It holds the horses of the guard, as well as those of any visitors.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_stable_2_desc;Several large fields just outside the palace have been graciously "donated" by local farmers and set aside as riding grounds. Here the fighting men can practise the art of war on horseback.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_stable_3_desc;A horse breeder has set up shop in the vicinity of the palace. The large pens can hold hundreds of animals, and ensure a steady supply of mounts for forces raised locally.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_bowyer_1_desc;A skilled bowyer has set up his small workshop inside the palace courtyard. Here he can make new bows or repair broken ones as needed.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_bowyer_2_desc;This target range lets the men practise their archery. There are several targets positioned at different distances, but as yet, no one has managed to split another's arrow.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_bowyer_3_desc;The crossbow is a marvelous invention. Though it can't be fired as quickly as a longbow, it requires little training to use effectively. This workshop ensures a steady supply of these deadly weapons.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_shipyard_1_desc;This room inside the palace is a cartographer's dream, and contains priceless maps of all sorts. Some are claimed to date back to the ancient Greeks, and others, whose accuracy cannot be gauged with any certainty, depict strange lands far to the east.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_shipyard_2_desc;This large shipyard is located along the coast, but it has been reserved for exclusive use by this dynasty. Skilled shipwrights stand ready to build trade galleys.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_shipyard_3_desc;This naval arsenal is located in the capital, but it is completely owned by this dynasty who has reserved all use of it for themselves. It is a huge complex that has everything needed to assemble and man an entire fleet.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_warehouse_1_desc;A large warehouse containing all the supplies necessary to field a military force, whether it be an army or a fleet.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_warehouse_2_desc;It is easy to get lost in this colossal archive housed entirely within the palace. It holds documents and records of all dynastic assets, from ships and buildings down to individual soldiers and clerks.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_warehouse_3_desc;This office deep within the palace acts as the nerve center of the entire dynastic empire. Here clerks and officials oversee the day-to-day affairs of trade negotiations and fleet deployments.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_garden_1_desc;A large and impressive garden filled with the manifold wonders of nature. This tranquil environment is ideal for moments of quiet reflection.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_garden_2_desc;This scenic pond, often frequented by swans, is the centerpiece of the palace garden. A small fountain in its middle sprays water into the air while carps can be glimpsed just beneath the surface.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_garden_3_desc;No self-respecting garden is complete without one. This intricate hedge maze delights visitors, and many dignitaries have spent hours navigating its twisting paths.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_cellar_1_desc;A well-stocked wine cellar is an absolute must for any aristocrat of rank, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. Some of the wines stored here date back decades.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_cellar_2_desc;These catacombs located far beneath the palace contain the dynastic tombs. Here countless generations dating back centuries are joined in eternal slumber. May they rest in peace.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_cellar_3_desc;This vast complex of dungeons is hidden away deep enough below the palace to block the cries of its unfortunate inhabitants. Every imaginable instrument of torture can be found within these cold and dark chambers.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_shrine_1_desc;A secluded shrine hidden away in a quiet wing of the palace. Here men and women can spend their time in prayer and introspective soul-searching.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_shrine_2_desc;This gallery occupies a large chamber in one of the palace wings, and it contains all works of art accumulated by members of this dynasty over the years - from contemporary tapestries to ancient marble sculptures from Greece and Rome.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_shrine_3_desc;A huge library containing all sorts of dusty old tomes collected and purchased from all over the known world by members of this dynasty. They are in many different languages and no person alive has read them all, but at least here they will be protected for posterity.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_vault_1_desc;This fortified vault deep within the palace is where the dynasty keeps all of their treasures collected over the years. Only the head of the dynasty has access to the vault keys, but the stories of piles upon piles of golden coins, deep enough for a man to dive around in like a porpoise, or burrow through like a gopher, must surely be false.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_vault_2_desc;These secret passages run through the entire palace, and enable those in the know to quickly move from one end to the other without being seen. By pulling on the right candelabrum, an unassuming bookshelf or a lit fireplace might slide open. Perfect for escaping would-be assassins or awkward social gatherings.;;;;;;;;;x 
fp_vault_3_desc;This hidden chamber inside the palace can only be reached through one of the secret passages, and even then several special keys are required. It serves as a well-protected retreat for the head of the dynasty, where he or she can safely plot the conquest of the world without irritating distractions.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_REP_002;You have just learned that the captain of one of your trade galleys has been selling part of his cargo to [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] smugglers instead of delivering it as ordered, apparently hoping the amount sold would be too small to be noticed. The captain and his crew have been jailed, but the thieving scum had already spent most of their ill-gotten profits on spirits and women.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_002;Can no one be trusted these days?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_003;One of your trade galleys finally made it back to port today after being delayed for several days by a storm. Sadly, it was discovered that the ship's entire cargo had been spoiled by seawater and rendered worthless. A total loss.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_003;Confound it all!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_005;A trade galley belonging to the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] shipping empire has been several days overdue. This morning another captain on the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] payroll came into port with flotsam from the lost ship, which he claims to have found in the wake of a recent storm. It looks like your galley was caught in it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_005;The sea shall be their grave.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_006;A convoy of several merchant galleys belonging to your family has been ambushed by pirates on the high seas! The brigands seized two of your ships, but there is sadly little that can be done for the captured crews. They will most likely be sold as slaves along with the cargo their ships were carrying.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_006;Barbarians!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_007;A convoy flying the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] standard was ambushed by pirates today while on their way home with their holds full of precious cargo. Thanks to the quick actions of their crews, they managed to turn the tables on the pirates and capture two of their galleys! The prize money will be divided evenly, but the lion's share goes to you!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_007;Finally some good news.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_008;One of your ships has returned from a foreign port with a cargo of rare spices of the very finest quality. Word has spread throughout [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], and the local nobility is already lining up at the docks, pleading for a chance to buy some of this precious cargo.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_008;The spice must flow.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_009;An enterprising captain in command of one of your galleys has discovered several new markets along foreign shores. He reports that these distant ports are rife with opportunities for trade and profit.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_009;Rule number 62... "The riskier the road, the greater the profit.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_010;To everyone's astonishment, a galley belonging to the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family that was thought lost years ago slipped quietly into port last night. The ship is riddled with arrows and the sails are barely holding together, but against all odds the captain managed to bring in his cargo. He has quite a story to tell.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_010;Better late than never!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_011;The lazy, ungrateful dockworkers in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] are refusing to unload ships! Citing poor working conditions and low pay, they will not let anyone past their picket line. Troops from all of the major families are working together to quickly silence the leaders of these mobs, but costly delays in shipping are unavoidable at this point.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_011;And after everything I've done for them...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_012;A large warehouse belonging to your family at the docks in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] has caught fire! The dockworkers have formed human chains and are passing buckets of water between each other to put the flames out before the fire has a chance to spread, but a lot of valuable goods have already been lost.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_012;What a disaster.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_014;A wealthy local noble is looking to escape the consequences of several indiscretions on his part against a female member of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. He has offered to pay handsomely for passage on one of your ships to a foreign port, where he can hopefully lay low for a few years.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_014;Of course. Make the arrangements.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_015;The dockworkers handling the loading and unloading of your ships have become quite efficient at their work. Disembarked crews are complaining that they barely have enough time to get drunk in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] before their galleys are ready to set sail again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_015;Keep up the good work, men.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_016;The rotting remains of a ship lost centuries ago was discovered by a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] galley in the port of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. Divers working for your family have managed to salvage a small treasure chest containing gold bullion!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_016;Let's see my share!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_017;Ships from the republic have traveled far and wide in their relentless pursuit of trading opportunities, and as a result the accuracy of your sailors' nautical charts has been improved. Coastal waters that were previously seen as treacherous can now be navigated in relative safety, shortening the time it takes to complete certain routes.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_017;You can never have too many charts.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_018;There is a lot of commotion at the docks of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. Apparently, the captain of one of your family's trade galleys rammed his ship into the pier while intoxicated. He was lynched by a furious crowd, but the other patrician families are holding you responsible for the damage to the dock facilities.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_018;That drunken fool.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_018;An understandable mistake...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_020;The captain of one of your trade galleys was fished out of the water by a ship working for the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family last week. Starved and half-mad from scurvy, the captain reports that his crew mutinied and tossed him overboard. They seem to have decided on a life of piracy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_020;My ship and cargo... lost!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_101;The Great Ball;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_101;[From.GetTitledName] will soon be hosting a great ball in [From.GetHerHis] family palace, and every patrician family in the republic has been invited - except for yours. Your dynasty's relation with the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family has been tense as of late, as you are competing with them in several important markets.\n\nThe decision not to invite [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] members to the ball can only be seen as a grave insult. As you sit brooding in the chambers of your own palace, you wonder how to tackle this situation. Will you turn up at the ball anyway, pretending there has been some mistake, or will you turn the other cheek and accept this affront to [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] honor?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_101;Ready my carriage!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_101;Oh well. What's a ball? I suppose it would be frightfully dull, and...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_REP_102;You decide to grace the ball with your presence, invitation or not.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_102;Arriving at the Ball...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_102;You show up at the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] family palace with your entourage, and make your way past the posted guards before they can block your way. Music and laughter can be heard from inside the palace, but it seems to die out the moment you step inside. Hushed whispers are all that can be heard as everyone's eyes seem to focus on you.\n\n"[Root.GetTitledFirstName]!" someone calls out. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] emerges from the crowd with a smile on his face. "How kind of you to join us. May I see your invitation?" As you struggle for words, guards surround you and your party. "No invitation? That's a shame." With a small wave from [FromFrom.GetFirstName], the guards drag you all outside and throw you down the stairs of the entrance. Lying on your back in the dirt, you see [FromFrom.GetFirstName] grinning down at you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_102;You will live to regret this, [FromFrom.GetFirstName]! Mark my words!;;;;;;;;;x 
feud_begins_tooltip;This will be the start of a great vendetta between your two families...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_104;The Even Greater Ball;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_104;As a way to get back at the vile [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family, you could make arrangements to host your own grand ball. Invitations will be sent out to all patrician families, with the exception of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] of course.\n\nIf this is to work, your ball will have to be much grander than the one that weasel [From.GetTitledFirstName] threw together. It won't be cheap, but it would restore your prestige and bring shame to those [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dogs...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_104;Make it happen! Spare no expense!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_104;I refuse to stoop to their childish level.;;;;;;;;;x 
no_own_ball_tooltip;You decide to just forget about this whole thing.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_REP_105;You make arrangements to hold a splendid ball.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_105;The Day of the Ball;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_105;The day of your grand ball has arrived and everyone of importance in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] is in your palace. Everyone but the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. Your guards have strict orders not to permit anyone from their bloodline inside.\n\nIn one corner of the ballroom, a bearded gentleman who looks vaguely familiar is loudly and unfavorably comparing your ball with the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] one. As you approach him to set him straight, you recognize something in his voice... could it be possible...? You rush forward and rip the thick beard from the man's face to reveal [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]! "YOU!"\n\nAstonished, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] pushes you aside and makes a mad dash for the exit like a frightened rabbit while shoving several dancing guests to the floor.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_105;Ha! Let him run.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_151;The [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] Flagship;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_151;Word has reached you that your mortal enemies, the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family, are planning the construction of a great galley the likes of which has never before been seen. It is to surpass even the bucentaur, the flagship of the Venetian Doge, in size and splendor. The hubris of [From.GetTitledFirstName] is without equal!\n\n[Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName], your [Root.GetSpymasterName], has put together a plan to make sure this atrocity never sails the seas. Men loyal to [Root.job_spymaster.GetHerHim] will infiltrate the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] shipyard in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] posing as shipwrights. Once inside, they will add several subtle structural flaws to the galley that will hopefully escape detection until it sets out on its maiden voyage...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_151;Brilliant! Send in the men!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_151;This hare-brained scheme will never work.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_152;The Marriage of the Sea;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_152;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to unveil the new [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship today, at the annual Marriage of the Sea ceremony where the maritime dominance of Venice is celebrated. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has invited [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] himself to oversee the ceremony from the great ship. As a long procession of ships sail through the city canals, the Pope drops one of his rings into the water and proclaims, "We wed thee, sea, in the sign of..." \n\nBefore he can finish the sentance, the galley lurches and begins to tip over! Both the Pope and [FromFrom.GetFirstName] are thrown overboard, but they are soon fished out of the water by some nearby gondoliers. The Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church wrings out his drenched robes while launching a long tirade of profanity directed at [FromFrom.GetFirstName], who has turned red with embarassment.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_152;Hahaha!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_153;The Ship is Launched;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_153;The [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship has been completed, and nobles from all over [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] have gathered at the docks to watch as the mighty vessel is put to sea. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is beaming with arrogant pride, especially when he spots you in the crowd. Before long, the sleek vessel slides into the water and hoists its sails who are adorned with the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] family crest.\n\nSuddenly the great galley snaps in half with a terrible crack! The crowd gasps in stunned silence, but [FromFrom.GetFirstName] turns to face you immediately, his eyes glowing with fury. "YOU! This was YOUR doing!" he screams as spittle sails from his mouth. With a howl he attempts to hurl himself at you, but his struggling aides hold him back. "I don't know how you did it, [Root.GetFirstName], but I swear you will pay for this! Do you hear me, [Root.GetFirstName]?! YOU WILL PAY!";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_154;The Lion of the Sea;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_154;You are sitting on the deck of a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] galley, enjoying the cool sea air and the smell of saltwater when a large shadow suddenly blocks out the sun. A colossal galley, easily twice the size of your ship, sweeps past dangerously close and sends a large wave sweeping over the deck that knocks you off your feet. It's the new [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship!\n\nAs you stand up, drenched from top to bottom, you hear cackling laughter from the deck of the other ship. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] stands by the railing looking down at you with a smug grin on his face. "Well, well, if it isn't [Root.GetTitledFirstName]! How are you doing down there? You should take better care when sailing in waters trafficked by larger vessels. I would hate for an accident to occur..." You turn away from him to hide your scowl.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_154;Gggh... that insufferable...!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_155;You Are Cordially Invited...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_155;Yet another public execution has been scheduled in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], and your attendance is required. Though these events normally bore you, this one catches your full attention when you realize that the convicted men about to be executed are the same men [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] sent to infiltrate the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] shipyard. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] joins the executioner and the convicts on their platform, and looks at you with a gloating smile.\n\n"My friends, take a long, hard look at these men," [FromFrom.GetFirstName] begins. "They are enemies of the Republic and together they conspired to sabotage the construction of the new [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] flagship. Fortunately, they were caught in the act and it has been revealed that they were not acting alone..." He gives you a long glance and you think you realize where this is going.;;;;;;;;;x

You immediately grab the nearest crossbow and send several bolts after [From.GetFirstName] while screaming obscenities at him. The vile lecher quickly retreats and disappears into some bushes, while you hurry towards your crying daughter's room to scold her for bringing such shame to the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] name.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_REP_163;You wake in the middle of the night after a restless sleep, and decide to go for a stroll through the empty corridors of your palace. For some reason, you can't shake the feeling that something is amiss. As you pass your son's room, you hear faint girlish laughter and other sounds of a carnal nature! You kick open the door to reveal your son in bed with a secret lover!\n\nTo your horror, you recognize the girl as [From.GetTitledFirstName] of the despicable [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family! As you furiously scold your son for bringing such shame to the family, the girl leaps out of bed wearing only the bedsheets and runs away in tears. The sound of her bawling echoes throughout the palace corridors, and it is matched in volume only by your voice as you discipline your son.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_163;You are not to see her again!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_164;Never Was a Story of More Woe...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_164;You are eating supper when the doors to your palace's dining room suddenly fly open and [FromFrom.Father.GetTitledFirstName] storms inside, chased by your guards. "Where is he?" [FromFrom.Father.GetFirstName] demands, pounding his fist on the table. "Damn it, [Root.GetFirstName]! Where is my son?!" He slams a piece of paper on the table. "I expressly forbade him from having anything to do with that harlot daughter of yours, but today I found this note!"\n\nHe reads with a somber voice: "'Father, since you would deny me the love of my life and since...' etc, etc, '...my love and I have decided to end it all. Farewell.'" With a gasp, you push the table aside and rush up the stairs towards your daughter's room with [FromFrom.Father.GetFirstName] on your heels. There, embracing each other on the floor, the two lovers lie dead next to an empty bottle of poison...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_164;This feud has cost us everything... it has to end.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_164;Y-you killed her! My sweet daughter!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_165;You are eating supper when the doors to your palace's dining room suddenly fly open and [FromFrom.Father.GetTitledFirstName] storms inside, chased by your guards. "Where is she?" [FromFrom.Father.GetFirstName] demands, pounding his fist on the table. "Damn it, [Root.GetFirstName]! Where is my daughter?!" He slams a piece of paper on the table. "I expressly forbade her from having anything to do with that no-good son of yours, but today I found this note!"\n\nHe reads with a somber voice: "'Father, since you would deny me the love of my life and since...' etc, etc, '...my love and I have decided to end it all. Farewell.'" With a gasp, you push the table aside and rush up the stairs towards your son's room with [FromFrom.Father.GetFirstName] on your heels. There, embracing each other on the floor, the two lovers lie dead next to an empty bottle of poison...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_165;Y-you killed him! My poor boy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_166;Wedding Bells;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_166;It is a day of joyous celebration! Despite the bitter rivalry between the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] families, love found a way to bridge that gap and bring a young couple together. You decided not to intervene, and it seems [FromFrom.Father.GetTitledFirstName] shared your sentiments and gave his blessings to the couple. Today they are joined in the sacred union of marriage.\n\nThis will hopefully be the start of a lasting peace between your families, and a new era of friendship. As the ceremony is completed and the festivities commence, you and [FromFrom.Father.GetFirstName] shake hands and share some wine together.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_166;A toast to the continued prosperity of our two families!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_168;Two Funerals and a Truce;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_168;The [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] and the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] families have come together on this day to mourn the recent loss of their two children. Yet amidst all the gloom there is a glimmer of hope for the future. You and [From.GetTitledFirstName] are meeting with all the ranking members of your two respective houses.\n\nTogether you have decided to finally end the bitter feud that has been raging longer than anyone can remember. It may be too late for your closest kin, but future generations of [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] children will no longer grow up seeing each other as mortal enemies.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_168;Let us never forget this day.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_182;The Smugglers of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_182;You have long suspected that the dastardly [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] family are smuggling illegal goods into [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], but now you have finally managed to confirm it through your sources. You have no proof, of course - [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is too clever for that. As you contemplate your options in your study, your son [From.GetFirstName] enters and presents a plan.\n\nHe has learned that a [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] smuggler is due to arrive in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] tomorrow night with a full hold. Together with some trusted men, he will lie in wait and seize the cargo as soon as the ship moors at the dock. The [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] smugglers won't know what hit them, and even if [FromFrom.GetFirstName] learns the truth, he won't be able to act against you without revealing the smuggling activities of his house. You could profit greatly by selling the smuggled goods...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_182;An excellent plan, [From.GetFirstName]. I am proud of you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_182;No, it is too risky.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_185;The Only Good Smuggler...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_185;As night falls over the docks of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], the smugglers quietly slip into port with their galley. They leave their lanterns unlit and skillfully rely on the moonlight to guide them in.\n\nWithout warning, masked men wearing dark robes suddenly leap onboard as the ship moors at the dock. Daggers glint in the moonlight and arrows whistle through the air. Soon five dead smugglers are floating with their faces down in the murky water below the docks, and the galley and its cargo, now under the command of [From.GetFirstName], slips away towards a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] port.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_185;Well done, my boy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_186;The Ultimate Sacrifice;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_186;You are drawn to your balcony in the middle of the night by someone calling your name. A group of riders with torches are standing just outside the walls of your palace, and you recognize [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] among them. In front of them, with his hands tied behind his back, stands [From.GetFirstName]. "One of my ships had a visit from some of your men, [Root.GetFirstName]," [FromFrom.GetFirstName] calls out. "They have all been dealt with, but I want a little something for the effort I spent tracking down your whelp."\n\nYour son pulls free from the riders, and shouts up at you: "Don't do it, father! Don't trust these [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] bastards!" [FromFrom.GetFirstName] knocks [From.GetFirstName] to the ground with the pommel of his sword. "Give me what I want, [Root.GetFirstName], and your boy will live. Otherwise..." He levels his sword at your son's head.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_186;I don't have that kind of money, damn you!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_186;You'll have your money! Just let [From.GetFirstName] go!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_REP_186;Be proud, my son. Chin up. Show these dogs how a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dies.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_191;The Right of Way;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_191;The port in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] is particularly busy today, but you have decided to take a small trip on one of your family's galleys and have no intention of cancelling your plans. Your captain skillfully guides the ship through the jumble of merchant vessels and towards the open sea. \n\nYou have nearly left the harbor area when another galley flying [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] colors recklessly cuts in front of you! The two galleys collide with the sound of splintering wood, but with the exception of several broken oars, there doesn't seem to be any serious damage to either ship. From the deck of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] galley, [From.GetTitledFirstName] screams obscenities at you and accuses you of trying to ram his ship on purpose. He demands the right of way to leave the port before you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_191;That does it. Ready the ship for battle!;;;;;;;;;x 
battle_tooltip;This time he has gone too far. You will sink his precious ship.;;;;;;;;;x 
no_battle_tooltip;You tell your crew to give the other ship the right of way.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_191;Oh, let that childish fool go first.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_192;Battle is Joined!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_192;Your ship is readied for battle, and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] immediately responds in kind. Bowmen take up position at the railing and hails of flaming arrows are soon exchanged between the ships. Nearby merchant vessels hurry to distance themselves from the duel, and as the furious battle continues both galleys drift out of the harbor and far out to sea.\n\nThe rigging of the [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] galley has caught fire, but you have little time to celebrate this victory as your own ship is taking on water. A savage boarding action unfolds as both crews fight to escape their equally doomed ships. When the smoke settles, both galleys have slipped beneath the waves and you and [FromFrom.GetFirstName] are desperately clutching to the same piece of flotsam, shouting insults at each other.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_192;I hope you're happy now!;;;;;;;;;x 
flotsam_tooltip;As the only survivors of the battle, the two of you drift aimlessly on the sea...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_194;Days of Toil and Hardship;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_194;You drift at sea for what seems like days, until you and [From.GetTitledFirstName] are finally picked up by a passing galley. Your relief at being rescued is shortlived, however, when the grinning captain announces to his crew: "Looks like the spider just caught a couple of flies."\n\nTo the sound of cracking whips and a steady drumbeat, you and [From.GetFirstName] are chained and put to work as oarsmen along with the other slaves on the pirate galley. The hours pass in a haze as you toil at the oars, and you are nearly at the point of passing out when [From.GetFirstName] shares his water ration with you. He receives a severe whipping for this, but as the guards are busy with him you notice that one of the links in your rusty chains looks ready to snap. The ship is passing close to shore, and you could probably make it...;;;;;;;;;x 
flee_ship_tooltip;You leap over the railing and swim to the safety of the shore.;;;;;;;;;x 
rescue_rival_tooltip;You decide not to abandon your former rival to the mercy of these pirates.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_194;So long, fools!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_194;I can't leave without [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_195;The Mutiny;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_195;Using your chain, you strangle the guard whipping [From.GetFirstName] and break free. The rest of the slaves take this as a cue to lash out at any pirate within their reach, and the ensuing commotion gives you enough time to sever [From.GetFirstName]'s chains with the fallen guard's scimitar. Together you work to free the rest of the slaves, and soon a full mutiny has broken out.\n\nMany slaves are cut down, but there are enough of them to overwhelm the pirates and within moments only their injured captain is left alive. "What now?" you ask [From.GetFirstName] as you sail back towards [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. "What now? Let me tell you what now," [From.GetFirstName] says. "We're even now. The feud between our families is no more. We've been through too much together." He offers you his hand in friendship...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_195;So be it, friend.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_195;After everything your family has done? Never!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_REP_201;The Wrath of the [From.GetTitle];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_201;These are hard times for the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family. Your sworn enemies, the vile and untrustworthy [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty under the leadership of [From.GetTitledFirstName], have managed to secure rulership of the Republic using guile and treachery.\n\nAs the [From.GetTitle] is still dependant on the favor of the majority of the patrician families, [From.GetFirstName] is hesitant to take overt action against your family and its supporters. This hasn't stopped him, however, from using every other avenue at his disposal to tarnish the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] name.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_201;Some day, the boot will be on the other foot...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_203;As [Root.GetTitle], you are in a unique position to act against the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] family, your old enemies. Striking at them directly might draw the ire of the other patrician families, whose continued favor is necessary to cement your dynasty's rule over the Republic, however.\n\nThe [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]s still enjoy a lot of support in many quarters of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName], but new, insidious ways of hurting them are open to you now with your current office. You have managed to tarnish their family's name and standing through an intensive lobby campaign.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_203;Heed the words of the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME_REP_206;Riots in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_206;Supporters of your family have clashed with [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] hooligans on the streets of [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]! What started as a bar-room brawl quickly turned into a riot when hundreds of sailors from the merchant fleets of both families joined in the destructive melee.\n\nNearly a dozen dead have so far been reported by the city guard, and several stores were looted during the commotion. The other patrician families are not amused by this disturbance of the peace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_206;They started it!;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_FACTIONS_VIEW_TITLE;The Faction View;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_FACTIONS_VIEW_TEXT_1;Here you can see an overview of the Factions active within your realm. Vassals will create Factions against their Liege with a specific goal in mind, such as lowering crown authority or placing a pretender on the throne. Other Vassals may then join the Faction if they agree with its stated goal.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_FACTIONS_VIEW_TEXT_2;Once a Faction becomes powerful enough, its members will present their Liege with an ultimatum. If this is refused, it could spark a Civil War.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_FACTIONS_VIEW_TEXT_3;There are a number of ways to make Vassals leave their Faction: you can dispatch your Spymaster to Scheme in their territory, you can increase their opinion of you with bribes, or you can simply hope for the best and have them assassinated. Note that if there are several Members in a faction, one of them will always take the Faction Leader's place if he or she leaves the Faction for any reason.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_FACTIONS_VIEW_TEXT_4;The upper section of this screen lists the Factions that your Vassals have formed against you, their Liege. If you have a Liege of your own, the lower section will show the Factions that you or your fellow Vassals have formed.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REPUBLIC_VIEW_TITLE;The Republic View;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REPUBLIC_VIEW_TEXT_1;This screen is available only to Merchant Republics, and it gives you an overview of the Republic's five Patrician Families. The ruler of a Maritime Republic is elected for life, but the office will not necessarily be inherited by his heir.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REPUBLIC_VIEW_TEXT_2;Every Patrician has a Respect value that is determined by a combination of their Age, their Prestige, and the amount of money they have contributed to their Campaign Fund. The Patrician with the highest Respect value becomes the Expected Successor, but that is still not a guarantee that he will be elected when the time comes for the Republic to choose a new ruler.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REPUBLIC_VIEW_TEXT_3;The Family Palace is a holding that will remain with the dynasty who owns it until that dynasty dies out. It does not exist on the map and so can never be conquered by an enemy. In stark contrast to a feudal lord, this enables Patricians to continue playing even if they don't own land.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REPUBLIC_VIEW_TEXT_4;Below the palace is a list of all Trade Posts owned by this family and the income they provide. Trade Posts can be built in both foreign and domestic provinces, and they are a vital component in the building of a successful trade empire.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_PLOT_VIEW_TEXT_2;The Decisions available to you depend on a number of factors, such as your character's religion. There are many different Decisions that cover everything from inviting new nobles to holding grand tournaments.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_REP_409;That sly old fox.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_411;Whispered rumors claim that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been spending quite a bit of time with a significantly older and unmarried widow in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName]. Today he finally announced he is in love with her, and that she has agreed to become his wife.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_411;So the rumors were true!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_413;Some time ago, a merchant galley working for the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family brought back several visiting dignitaries from a distant land far to the south. It seems one of them, a woman, has become the target of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s infatuation. After courting her for weeks, she has finally agreed to marry him, take up his faith, and settle in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_413;Fate brought them together, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;x
