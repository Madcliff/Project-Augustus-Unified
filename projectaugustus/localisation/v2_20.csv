WELCOME_HEADER;Welcome to Crusader Kings II;;;;;;;;;x 
#WELCOME_TEXT;You can play as any medieval ruler at any point in time, from a lowly count to an all-powerful emperor. When your character dies, you will need an heir to take over, and so on, down the ages. The starting situation is historical - and thus completely unbalanced. Check the difficulty estimation of a ruler before you start playing!;;;;;;;;;x 
WELCOME_FIRST_PLAY_RECOMMEND;\n\nFor your first game we strongly recommend playing a special learning scenario as §YKing Alfonso VI of León§!. When it ends you can keep playing as normal.;;;;;;;;;x

#EVTDESC107000;Behold! The world as we know it in the year of our Saviour, 1066. As you can tell, it is divided into distinct regions - Counties - each controlled by some lord or another. Crusader Kings II is a game about these lords, their families, relations, intrigue... and power. Be a conqueror or a peaceful family father, as you will, but know that most other characters will lust after more land, more Counties.\n\nCrusader Kings II is a real-time game.

#EVTDESC107001;You will play as a succession of characters from the same Dynasty, down the ages. In this Learning Scenario, you will be safe from attack and internal strife until your ruler turns 40 years old. When this happens, [Root.GetFirstName] will die (normally though, characters die of old age, disease or violence) and the Learning Scenario will end. When [Root.GetSubjectPronoun] dies, you can keep playing a normal game as [Root.GetPossPronoun] Heir.

EVTDESC107002;The main currencies in this game are your Wealth, Prestige and Piety. Wealth is of course the monetary currency (you can call it 'gold' if you like), and increases primarily through taxation. Prestige is a measure of your success and prestige as a ruler, and your Piety shows how respected you are by the clergy. The Prestige and Piety of all your characters will be added to your score, determining your final rank when the game ends.;;;;;;;;;x

You can also click on the Crest next to the portrait to get information about your Country.\n\nClick the Portrait to find out more about your Ruler and his family. Note that you are currently unmarried and your Heir is your brother, the King of Castille. Should you die at this point, you can keep playing as him since he is of your Dynasty.

EVTDESC107006;In the same screen, you can also see your Attributes and Traits, which represent your skills and personality.\n\nCharacters can also have an Ambition, which represents their current short term goal. Whenever an Ambition is fulfilled the character will get a reward, such as a Prestige or Piety bonus. Click on the 'Choose an Ambition'-button, look at your Ambitions and choose one.

EVTDESC107007;Although you do have a valid Heir of your Dynasty (your brother), having children of your own will ensure that there is a next generation of successors. Besides, your brother might die before you do. As soon as you have a son, he will be your new Heir. To produce legitimate children you need to get married! The Arrange Marriage view, found by clicking on your portrait, is a good tool for finding suitable spouses (it's the button with the two golden rings). You can also use the Character Browser in the bottom right corner of the screen to find more characters.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP107008;Help to find good spouses will follow.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107008;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107008;When looking at potential spouses, there are a few things you should keep in mind: First, your spouse's Attributes will boost your own, so a skilled spouse is preferably. Secondly, marriages are the only way to secure Alliances in the game, so try to marry into the close family of rulers you want to ally. Third, you cannot marry children, but you can betroth them (though that will not yield any Attribute boost.) Right now it would be wise to marry a healthy adult woman of childbearing age.;;;;;;;;;x

#EVTDESC107009;When you have found a good character to marry, click on their portrait and the Diplomacy Icon to open the Diplomatic View (if you do this through the Arrange Marriage function you need only click the portrait).

EVTNAME107101;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107101;Your Realm consists of a number of Counties (the provinces on the map). Each County contains at least one Holding (Castle, City or Temple). By clicking on a County you can see - among other things - its Holdings. The Holdings held by you personally are collectively called your Demesne. Unfortunately, there is a limit to how many Holdings you can control directly. This value is shown in the top bar. If you have more Holdings than your limit, you will start to suffer serious penalties...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA107101;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107102;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107102;The Demesne Limit is the reason you need Vassals! You can control more Holdings than your Demesne Limit allows indirectly through your Vassals. Your Vassals will give a part of their troop Levies and Taxes to you. There is a limit to how many Vassals you can have as well, which is why you might want to have fewer - but more powerful - Vassals. Vassals can also have Vassals, and so on. Vassals of the lowest rank (below Count, with a copper portrait frame) are not counted towards the Vassal Limit.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA107102;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107103;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107103;You need to keep your Vassals happy, because their Opinion of you controls how much Tax and Levies they will give you. If they dislike you enough, they might even join rebellious Factions, which can lead to civil wars. Bishops (priestly vassals) who like the Pope more than you will actually send their Taxes to him instead! Opinions are represented by a number ranging from -100 to 100, and you can see exactly why they feel the way they do by hovering over the number.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA107103;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107104;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
#EVTDESC107104;You currently have one unhappy Vassal. You can find this Vassal by clicking on your portrait and open the 'Vassals' tab. Try to increase the Opinion of this Vassal to a positive number. You can increase the Opinion of your Vassals towards you in several ways, for example by giving them more land (but do try to hold as much land as your Demesne Limit allows!). You can also give them an Honorary Title, or send them a gift. All this can be done in the Diplomacy View.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME107202;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107202;Oh dear, it seems the ungrateful peasants of Salamanca have revolted against you! To deal with the Revolt, you need to raise your Levies. If you go to the Military View you will see the buttons that allow you to raise your Personal Levies and your Vassal Levies.

EVTNAME107250;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107250;You dealt with the Revolt nicely! Now that you are at peace, it would be wise to dismiss your Levies.

EVTOPTA107250;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107251;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107251;Now would be a good time to consider expanding your Realm. The easiest targets for military expansion are small neighboring realms. However, since you need to know about fleet operations, let's pick Canarias, a single County realm just off the coast of West Africa...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME107252;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107252;In order to go to War in Crusader Kings II, you'll need a Casus Belli - a 'just cause'. A valid Casus Belli could be, for example, pressing a Claim on a Province that is rightfully yours, or waging a Holy War against infidels.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA107252;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107253;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107253;Claims can be obtained in several ways: First, you will usually get Claims on any Titles inherited by your siblings when your parents die. Rulers who lose Titles (in a War, for example) will also get Claims on any lost lands. Lastly, of course, Claims can also be fabricated by a crafty ruler... Since Canarias is so distant, you can, unfortunately, not use the Holy War Casus Belli, so you must Fabricate a Claim.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA107253;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107254;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107254;To Fabricate Claims, open your Council View and assign your Chancellor to Fabricate Claims and place him in the County of Canarias.

EVTOPTA107302;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107303;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
#EVTDESC107303;It appears you don't have enough ships to transport the Army. Sometimes when you're at War, the Levies from your Demesne and your Vassals might not be enough. In these cases it is wise to hire Mercenaries. This can be done via the Mercenaries Tab in the Military View. Newly hired Mercenaries arrive in your capital County. They are very expensive, both to hire and maintain. Take a look at the mercenary composition before you hire them. Some are made entirely out of Armies while others consist only of Fleets. Hire some naval mercs! They will spawn in a Sea Area West of your Realm.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA107303;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107304;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
#EVTDESC107304;To load your troops onto ships, bring your Fleet into port by ordering it to move into one of your land Provinces. You can then move your Armies to the same Province and click the Embark Army button.

#EVTDESC107306;When your Armies stop in enemy lands, they will start to besiege any enemy Holdings. In order to fully occupy a Province, you will need to take every Holding in that Province.

EVTDESC107307;If you want to win a Siege quickly, you can choose to Assault the besieged Holding. There is no guarantee of success, however, and even a successful Assault may come at a high cost to the attacking Army. Castles tend to have stronger Fortification levels than Cities and Church Holdings.

EVTOPTA107310;Got It!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME107311;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107311;When offering Peace you have three possible options to choose from. You can either Surrender, Offer White Peace or Enforce Demands.

EVTNAME107320;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107320;Now that the War is over, you can dismiss your Mercenaries and Levies again. Find a new target for expansion, and consider placing your Chancellor there to Fabricate Claims. You can also use the Holy War Casus Belli against your Muslim neighbours. The latter can be a bit more risky since any ruler of the opposing religion might join your enemy in the War.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME107325;Learning Scenario;;;;;;;;;x 
#EVTDESC107325;You are now over your Demesne Limit, meaning you have more Holdings than is seemly for you to rule personally. Your Vassals will dislike you for being over this limit, so you need to do something about it, and soon! In the long term, you can increase your demesne limit by increasing your Stewardship Attribute (and your wife's), but in the short term you need to give some of your Titles to your Vassals.

HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3_CHRISTIAN;Many of the Christian faiths have Patriarchates as well as a religious head. Autocephalous Patriarchs existed as Patriarch rulers for their kingdom, and therefore different realms can have different religious heads even though they share the same religion.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4_CHRISTIAN;The Iconoclast faith does not initially have a Patriarch. They can, however, form a Patriarchate if Constantinople is held. Furthermore, Orthodox rulers of the Byzantine Empire can mend the Great Schism between the Orthodox and Catholic churches by controlling all five Pentarchs.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3_CHRISTIAN_NOHEAD;Some of the Christian heresies have no religious head. This applies to, for example, the Cathars, Waldensians, Lollards, Bogomilists and Messalians.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4_CHRISTIAN_NOHEAD;Among these religions, the Cathar faith stands out since they even allowed women to be priests. Furhtermore does the Messalian stands out since they did not only allow female priests, but also close kin marriage similar to the Zoroastrians.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3_CATHOLIC;The Catholic faith is a bit special since the Pope is considered God's representative on Earth. He has more powers than other religious heads, but there is a catch - many Bishops feel more loyal to him than to their secular liege, and will send their taxes to Rome. One way around this problem is to set up an Antipope - a puppet pope who will do what he's told.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4_CATHOLIC;Another way of ensuring friendly Bishops is to change the Kingdom law to Crown or Free Investiture Law and nominate loyalists to your bishoprics.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3_ZOROASTRIAN;Zoroastrian rulers can please their vassals with close kin marriage in order to strenghten their dynasties. Zoroastrians are more resilient to becoming inbred, but the risk of this happening does still exist.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4_ZOROASTRIAN;The High Priesthood of the Zoroastrian faith has ceased to exist, but can be reinstituted if the Persian Empire is once again held by a Zoroastrian ruler.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3_INDIAN;The Indian religions have no religious heads, and they are all somewhat accepting towards other Indian religions and will find it harder to convert these. They can however subjugate each other, and some of them also allow Holy Wars against non-Indian religions.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4_INDIAN;Despite their similarities, the Indian religions also have their distinct differences. Jain rulers can build the most stable realms, but are also the least aggressive and have no Holy Wars. Hinduism is the most warlike religion of the three, but have a caste system which restricts the status and relationships of characters. Finally, the Buddhist faith gives a large bonus to technological advancement.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3_JEWISH;At game start, the Jewish faith has no religious head. You can, however, change this by restoring the High Priesthood. This can be done by any Jewish ruler who owns the province of Jerusalem.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4_JEWISH;The Kingdom of Israel can be restored if the lands belonging to the promised land are controlled by a Jewish ruler.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3_PAGAN;The Pagan faiths differs from the other religions in that they start as very decentralized and have no head of religion. Rulers following these unreformed religions are forced to use Gavelkind succession and can not use the Holy War Casus Belli. However, unreformed pagans get a defensive supply limit penalty for religious enemies in their provinces, and a mighty subjugation Casus Belli towards other pagans that they can use once per lifetime.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4_PAGAN;Pagan religions can be reformed by controlling at least three holy sites for that religion and having at least 50% Moral Authority, or by holding all five holy sites. The one who reforms a pagan religion in some cases become its new head. Be aware, however, that not all your vassals might agree with the reformation and some might see you as a heretic.;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3_MUSLIM;Muslim dynasties risk growing more and more decadent unless their men hold lands or they are victorious in wars. Increases in decadence can be prevented by getting rid of decadent Dynasty members or by simply giving land to them..;;;;;;;;;x 
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4_MUSLIM;Muslim leaders have a powerful invasion Casus Belli that can be used against neighbouring realms if their leaders do not follow the True Faith. Successful invasions will not only grant you the contested provinces, but also any other of the enemy's territories that you occupy.;;;;;;;;;x 
DECADENCE_DESC;All adult Muslim men below the rank of Count risk acquiring the §YDecadent§! trait, especially those of low character. The amount of Decadence these men incur on their dynasty depends on their own social status as well as the total amount of Holdings controlled by the Dynasty. Decadence affects the tax income from your demesne and the morale damage that demesne levies take in battle. Ways to halt or decrease Decadence include:\n§G*§! Granting landed titles to dynasty members\n§G*§! Successfully convincing decadent Dynasty members to abandon their sinful ways.\n§G*§! Imprisoning, banishing or killing decadent Dynasty members\n§G(The Religion View contains a list of decadent dynasty members.)§!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_CM_1000;A realm divided;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1000;As your father Pepin died, he divided the Empire of the Franks and left one half to you and the other half to your brother. He divided the lands in such a way as to force you to cooperate - but it does not appear to have had the desired effect. The friction is constant, and at every turn it seems your brother is now trying to thwart your plans and weaken your position. You still rule as joint kings, but surely this peace cannot last...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1000;He will not succeed in his vile schemes!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1002;The death of Charlemagne;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1002;With the death of your brother [From.GetFirstName], the prestige and honor of the Frankish kingship falls on you. He was your rival but now he is no more.

EVTDESC_CM_1021;Your mother has come to see you. As she is shown in, she falls to her knees in front of you and says: 'My dearest son. I know my support for your brother in your struggle may have caused you grief. After his death, I have seen how wrong I was to take sides. Please, can you find it in your heart to forgive me and take me into your household, so that I may now repay the injury that I have done to you with new love and loyalty?';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1021;I forgive you, Mother.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_CM_1021;Begone, witch!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1024;My son,\nI write to you to ask that you stop causing trouble for your brother and do not interefere with his plans.

[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] sees all and family should not fight with family.\n\nYour loving mother,\n[From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1024;It is clear that she is not on my side.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1027;Bertrada;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1027;Your mother has come to see you. She speaks to you of your brother and the rivalry between you: 'My dear Charles, it grieves me so that your brother Carloman will not support you as he should but rather has wicked designs on your domains. Rest assured, however, that I shall do all in my power to help and support you. I have even written to him, asking him to cease his plotting and acknowledge that, though the realm is divided between you, he recognize you as the primary ruler of the Franks. I fear, however, that he will not listen to me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1027;I thank you for your support, Mother.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1050;Roland;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1050;A young nobleman called Roland has approached you, declaring that he wishes to serve you. You have heard his name before, he is known to be a strong warrior and able diplomat, wise beyond his years and especially familiar with the Breton lands to the west. He would surely be a useful addition to your court.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1050;Welcome, Roland!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_CM_1050;I don't need a new knight.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1052;You have been spending a lot of time talking to [From.GetFullName] recently. He is not only loyal but also wise, amiable and very good company. You find you have many things in common.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1052;A good and stalwart friend.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1053;Roland the Brave;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1053;Your loyal knight Roland is truly distinguishing himself on campaign. He never fears to lead from the front in battle, he fires up his soldiers with his personal bravery, and he is always first into the fray and the last to withdraw. Where outriders are needed for dangerous scouting missions he insists on going, often being away for days behind enemy lines. If only all your soldiers were this brave and dedicated.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1053;A model knight indeed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1055;The Death of Roland;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1055;The battle won, Roland led a small group of knights in aggressive pursuit, leaving the rest of the army far behind. Penetrating deep through the enemy formations and causing havoc, they caused much damage. Then no one knows what happened - maybe they went too far, or maybe they were surprised by an unexpected counterattack. None of them returned...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1055;Alas! He was my bravest knight!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1057;As your army was retreating, the battle lost, Roland took a small group of knights and rode out to raid the enemy's flank and harass them in order to slow them down so that the rest of your forces could escape. It is said that they fought fiercely and valiantly. However, none of them returned...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1100;The Saxon Wars;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1100;The heathen Saxons living North of the realms of the Franks have for a long time held their own against all foreign conquerors, while defiantly staying true to their old religion and raiding Christian lands with no fear of God. No longer shall it be so - the time has come to bring them both the Sword and the Cross. Mercy is something they will find in the next life, should they accept baptism before they perish.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1100;Crush the heathens!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1101;Irminsul;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1101;You have captured the great pagan sanctuary at Paderborn, one of the holiest places of Germanic paganism. Here stands the great holy tree of Irminsul, which is said to have an immense importance in the heathen faith of the Saxons. To them, Irminsul represents the 'world tree' and is a focus from which they appear to draw much moral strength and inspiration.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1101;Burn it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_CM_1101;Keep it and build a grand Christian church on the site.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_CM_1101;Leave this devil-tree well alone.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1102;Irminsul destroyed;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1102;As the bitter war in Saxony rages on, the armies of [From.GetTitledName] have captured Paderborn, the site of the great shrine of the holy tree of Irminsul. By order of the conquering [From.GetTitle], the troops burned the holy tree and then proceeded to destroy the entire shrine. This has enfuriated people of the Germanic religion everywhere.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1102;Irminsul! We will have our revenge!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_CM_1102;A foul sacrilege!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_CM_1102;Gloria in excelsis Deo!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1104;The Blood Court of Saxony;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1104;During the course of the Saxon War, you have captured a lot of Saxon prisoners. Many of them are of noble birth and also very defiant in their views and attitude to our righteous Christian conquest. They keep to their heathen ways and scorn the name of Christ. Perhaps it is time to teach these stubborn Saxons a lesson through a show of strength. If we should try, condemn and execute these captured heathen leaders, we may strengthen our cause, please God and put fear into the hearts of our enemies.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1104;Behead them all!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_CM_1104;I shall be merciful even to these heathens.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1105;Widukind;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1105;The Saxons are a people that cling fiercely to their old traditions. After suffering defeats and conquest in spite of tenacious resistance, discontent has continued to simmer in the Pagan Saxon lands. Raids on tax collectors, defiance of church duties, all these things have been annoyances to the new rulers without really presenting any severe danger. Now, however, things seem to have changed. A rebel leader has emerged, uniting the rebellious Saxons and gathering warriors for more concerted attacks. He calls himself Widukind, a name that means 'Child of the Woods', in obvious reference to old Pagan myths and fitting to the hit-and-run tactics used by his forces thus far. The army he is gathering is growing, however...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1105;These indomitable Saxons!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_1108;Baptism of Widukind;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_1108;My Lord, your old enemy Widukind of the Saxons has sent word. He says he recognizes not only the strength of your arms but also the superiority of the Christian faith. He asks for free passage to come to your court in order to be baptized as a Christian. He says he wishes only peace between you and in return for your generosity he will be forever your loyal servant and stay true to the creed of the [Root.Religion.Getname] Church.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_1108;I will welcome him and baptize him.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_CM_1108;Let's invite him here and then kill him.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_CM_1108;I shall not even dignify such a proposal with an answer.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_CM_501;Fall of the Avars;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_501;The Avar Khaganate was established in Europe in 567 after the Avars had migrated into the Carpathian basin from the east. They crushed the Gepids and allied with the Lombards to form a strong realm in the area. For long periods they alternated between conflict and truce with the Eastern Roman Empire and had close dealings with the Lombard kings. Now, however, this once proud realm has fallen - the area is no longer ruled by an Avar dynasty and shall once again be known by the ancient name of Pannonia.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_501;Hail to the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_CM_502;The Kingdom of Italy;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_502;The ancient Lombard Kingdom was established in Italy after a long history of migration originating in Northern Europe. Along the way, the Lombards themselves have changed, both influencing and becoming influenced by the regions they have settled. Now it has finally come to pass that the Lombard lands in Italy no longer have a Lombard ruler and this effectively spells the end of the name of the Kingdom of the Lombards. We shall henceforth speak of the Kingdom of Italy, but the Lombard heritage shall live on...;;;;;;;;;x

DARK_AGES;Early Middle Ages;;;;;;;;;x 
DARK_AGES_INFO;The Early Middle Ages started with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the early 5th century. The earlier part of this era saw the great Germanic and Slavic migrations across Europe, with peoples such as the Goths and Lombards settling in Southern Europe, the Franks settling in Gaul and Saxons crossing the sea and settling in Britain. The Eastern Roman Empire was violently shaken by the pressure from the Goths and Avars, and fought bitterly with the ancient Persian enemy. The rise of Islam saw the Arabs conquering immense amounts of territory in the Middle East and North Africa, and in India several great dynasties vied for dominance, with the Rashtrakutas rising towards the end of the 8th century. In the steppes, the Khazars grew in power, and in Scandinavia things were about to change in a way that was to affect the entire continent...;;;;;;;;;x 
VIKING_ERA;Viking Age;;;;;;;;;x 
VIKING_ERA_INFO;By the middle of the 9th century, the Norse raiders and adventurers known as the Vikings had already begun to set their indelible mark on the map of Europe, establishing realms in Russia and the British Isles and travelling and raiding as far as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Karling rulers, descendants of Charlemagne, ruled mighty realms in France, Germany and Italy, while the Muslim religion was now firmly established in Spain under the Umayyads. The Byzantine emperor held on, though suffering under increasing pressure from the Caliphate and the Bulgarians. West of the fractured Steppes, The Magyars were poised to make their claim on the Carpathian basin. Islam was spreading rapidly in Persia under rulers such as the Saffarids, and had penetrated into the Indus valley. Further East, the Hindu Pratihara dynasty was expanding.;;;;;;;;;x 
EARLY_MED;High Middle Ages;;;;;;;;;x 
EARLY_MED_INFO;By the late 10th and early 11th centuries the Muslim world was changing, with Turkish dynasties such as the Seljuks and Ghaznavids now dominating Persia. The Byzantine Empire was still holding its own but was to see worse times coming. Central and Western continental Europe was split between France and a strong Holy Roman Empire, while Christian kings were advancing against a fractured and weakened Muslim Spain. Scandinavia was quickly converting to Christianity, and the Norse settlers in Russia and Britain had become assimilated with the local populations. Yet Viking descendants in Normandy and Italy were preparing new conquests, and the time of the First Crusade was approaching...;;;;;;;;;x 
HIGH_MED;Age of the Mongols;;;;;;;;;x 
HIGH_MED_INFO;As Europe entered the 13th century, Constantinople had been weakened by the Turks and sacked by the Fourth Crusade, so the Byzantine Empire was very much weakened. The Turks still reigned in the Middle East and Persia, in India many new kingdoms vied for power after the fall of the old dynasties. The Norman conquest had brought new political and dynastic struggles to England and France, the Christian kingdoms in Spain were continually growing stronger, Scandinavia had left paganism behind and was becoming more centralized. In Russia several principalities struggled for power in the shadow of the Bolghars and Cumans to the east. In Germany and Italy, the Holy Roman Empire still stood firm, but beyond all this, to the east, a new power was to come into play. When the Mongols broke into Eastern Europe and Persia, it changed the balance of power in all of Western Eurasia...;;;;;;;;;x 
LATE_MED;Late Middle Ages;;;;;;;;;x 
LATE_MED_INFO;Europe in the Late Middle Ages was a very different place compared to a few hundred years earlier. Spain was dominated by the Christian kingdoms, the Muslim rulers only clinging on in the south. The Holy Roman Empire still dominated Central Europe next to a strong Hungary, while in France and England dynastic conflicts with roots in the Norman conquest were to lead to long and bloody wars. The Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate dominated the Steppes and Persia, forcing every ruler between Central Europe and India to take the Mongols into account. The Tughluq dynasty ruled an immense empire in India, while North Africa was divided between various Arab dynasties. Turkish domination in the Middle East seemed to have been ended by the Mongol conquests, but in Anatolia a dynasty known as the Ottomans was stirring...;;;;;;;;;x 
PICK_ERA_YEAR;$YEAR$ A.D.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_6392;Son of Pepin the Short and a descendant of Charles Martel, Charlemagne (or Karl, as his contemporaries called him) became joint king of the Franks with his brother Karloman in 769. After a two-year power struggle, Karloman suddenly and conveniently fell ill and died, leaving Karl as sole ruler of the Franks.  He then proceeded to make the kingdom greater than ever before, conquering Saxony, Lombardy and other lands with equal measures of good strategic planning and ruthlessness. He was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor by pope Leo III, and his descendants were to rule large parts of Europe for a long time to come.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_144999;Karloman became joint king of the Franks together with his brother Karl in 768. The two brothers were not friends, rather a rivalry ensued. Karloman was outmaneuvered by his brother's alliance with the Lombards, and sought the support of the Pope in order to counter this, but did ultimately not succeed. He died unexpectedly in 771, just as war for the Frankish crown seemed inevitable. It has been claimed that he was poisoned, but this was never proven...;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_73679;Abd-al-Rahman I was born near Damascus in Syria, but had to flee his homeland when the Abbasids took power. He spent several years in exile before arriving in Spain, where he managed to seize power and declare himself ruler of Al-Andalus. He wanted to return east and avenge himself on the Abbasids, but the need to deal with issues closer to home kept preventing him from doing so. He instead set his mark on the history of Spain, establishing the rule of his dynasty there for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_190347;Desiderius became King of the Lombards in 756 after putting down the revolt of his rival Ratchis. Throughout his reign, he was constantly in competition with the popes and the southern dukes for domination of Italy. He sought an alliance with Charlemagne but when the latter divorced his daughter relations were soured. Eventually the kingdom was invaded and conquered by the Franks, making Desiderius the last Lombard king.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_34002;Al-Mansur became sole ruler of the Caliphate after the death of his brother. After defeating several potential challengers to his rule, he led a long and relatively stable reign over his huge empire. His time in power saw the rise of new Islamic literature and scholarship, thanks to cultural tolerance, conversion of new peoples and groups to Islam and a further inclusion of the Persian world into the Caliphate. His reign also saw tentative diplomatic contacts with realms as far away as China.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_74413;Krishna I of the Rashtrakuta dynasty took power in 756, defeating several competitors for the throne in order to secure his realm. He fought wars against the Chalukyas and Pratiharas and conquered Karnataka, making his dynasty more powerful than ever before. He was also a great patron to builders and commissioned many new temples and monuments.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_163112;Halfdan Whiteshirt was born the son of legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok. He made several successful expeditions, journeying primarily to England, and later was one of the leaders of the Great Heathen Army of 865. Halfdan managed to build a large realm for himself in England, including areas as far south as London, but later ran into trouble with his peers and was expelled from the realm. He then sought out new adventures and eventually died as a Viking on another bold expedition.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_40605;Rurik was a viking of Swedish origin who took advantage of the internal struggles of the tribes around Ladoga to conquer and establish a strong Norse realm in the east. His successors expanded their influence and eventually ruled as far south as Kiev, and the dynasty soon also adopted the Slavic language and customs (as Viking settlers often did). The descendants of Rurik would eventually become the first Tsars of Russia.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_90104;When Louis the Pious died, civil war broke out in the Carolingian Empire between his sons due to disagreements over the inheritance. In the settlement that followed the war, Charles was given West Francia. Once Lothair died, however, the balance of power was broken and Charles fought long and bitterly with his brother Ludwig over primacy and over the lands that Lothar had left behind. After Ludwig's death, Charles tried to make a grab for the German lands, but he died during the resulting war in 877 while crossing the Alps.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_90107;After making peace with his brothers at the Treaty of Verdun, Ludwig ruled over East Francia and Bavaria, lands that he had already administrated before his father's death. After this, he was locked in constant struggles to expand his power in the Frankish Empire, sometimes allying with his brother Charles the Bald and sometimes fighting him. He was also engaged with suppressing rebellions in Saxony and fighting wars on the Moravian border. He was a great sponsor of the church, using it as a means to suppress pagan subjects, and Germany started to develop its own identity as a kingdom during his reign.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1700;Basil the Macedonian was born to simple peasant parents in Macedonia. After a tumultuous early life, he eventually entered the service of relatives of the imperial house. With time, he became a friend and confidant of Emperor Michael. Using his position to advance his interests, he soon became co-emperor and eventually murdered Michael to become sole emperor. Once in power, he developed a reputation for efficiency and dedication to the empire. He restored good relations with the Pope and strengthened the eastern frontier in spite of hard-fought wars with the Paulicians and the Arabs.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_34014;Al-Mu'tazz became Caliph in 866, at only 19 years of age, in a situation where the Abbasid Empire was rife with power struggles between different factions. After a very bloody period of dealing with his various enemies he looked like he was coming out on top, but by then his coffers were empty and a rebellion among the soldiers turned his fortunes around. In the end he was taken prisoner, beaten and locked in a room to starve to death. He was 24 years old when he died.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_140;William the Conqueror, a descendant of the Viking chief Rollo, became duke of Normandy at a very young age, a situation compounded by the fact that he was also a bastard. Early on he was constantly being used as a pawn by rival factions in the duchy, with a succession of his guardians being murdered. Once he reached adulthood, he faced years of warfare in order to take full control over his duchy, eventually emerging victorious. In 1066 he successfully invaded England to press a claim on the English throne. He spent the remainder of his reign consolidating and reforming his new kingdom in the face of sometimes fierce opposition.;;;;;;;;;x 
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_1316;As son of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, Heinrich was crowned King of Germany when he was only 11 years old. When he became older he undertook extensive travels across his domains, taking great interest in his position and also in pious matters. As a young man, he launched several successful military campaigns against Bohemia and Hungary. Once crowned emperor in 1046, he continued to rule actively and participated in several more wars on the empire's borders.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1128;Robert Guiscard was the sixth son of Tancred de Hauteville, a petty Norman lord. Just like his brothers, he left Normandy with a small force of followers to seek his fortune in Italy. A brilliant and ruthless leader, he spent several years building a reputation as a mercenary, and the ever changing political landscape in Italy eventually saw the pope investing him as Duke of Apulia. In further campaigns, he proceeded to conquer Sicily, fighting both the Saracens and the Byzantines to secure control. He thus established Norman rule in southern Italy and his conquests had a profound long term impact on the region.;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_98003;Béla IV came from the long lineage of the Árpád rulers of Hungary. He refused to swear fealty to the Mongol Khan Ögödei and thus was faced with a Mongol invasion of Hungary. All seemed lost but salvation came with the death of Ögödei in 1242 since Batu of the Golden Horde ordered the army to safeguard the election of a new Great Khan back in Asia. Béla spent the following years building his kingdom in preparation for another Mongol invasion and became known as the Second Founder of the State.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_478011;Hulegu was the grandson of Genghis Khan. When his brother Möngke became Great Khan, Hulegu was ordered to conquer the remaining Muslim territories in western Asia. For his campaign he was assigned the largest Mongol army assembled and with it he ravaged the important Muslim cities of Baghdad and Damascus. This effectively pushed the centre of Muslim power west to the Mamluks in Cairo. He was also responsible for destroying the Hashashins. The lands he conquered became the foundation for the Ilkhanate which became a major power in the Middle East.;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_471500;Casimir the Great inherited the throne of Poland in 1333 and continued his fathers work in unifying the Polish kingdom. During his lifetime he went on military campaigns to expand his realm to the east and solidify his borders in the west. To get support from the Hungarian nobles he also promised them the Polish throne if he would end up heirless. Unfortunately he didn't manage to produce a legal male heir, in spite of his four different marriages, and after his death in 1370 the Hungarians pressed their claim to the Polish crown and ended the Piast dynasty.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_CM_6100;And no one shall know but me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6101;It seems that your [GetFromRelation]'s spirit has been suffering greatly from hiding away for so long, enough to drive [From.GetHerHim] insane...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6101;Alas!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_CM_6101;We must speak sometime!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6102;You sit in hiding, thinking of your enemies, how they could get to you and how you might prevent it. You go over all your plans again and again - did you really take the proper precautions? Are there any persons close to you that might plot against you? Can you really trust the guards?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6102;I'd better check under my bed again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6104;Hiding from your enemies, you gain little opportunity for spending time with others. Also, there is little opportunity for 'spending time' with others. You find, however, that you are getting used to it. Indeed, the absence of carnal thoughts makes you feel strangely pure and more at ease with yourself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6104;It's much better like this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6105;[From.GetFirstName] has been hiding from [From.GetHerHis] enemies for some time now, living in relative isolation. The experience seems to have changed [From.GetHerHim].

EVTOPTA_CM_6105;Hell hath no fury...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_CM_6105;Finally [From.GetSheHe] will leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6106;Living your life in hiding, you have much time to reflect on your situation. Sometimes there is fear, sometimes there is doubt. As the long hours pass at night, you find yourself increasingly taking comfort in religious musings. With time, the hope that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will protect you strengthens and becomes certainty.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6106;[Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] holds the answers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6108;It is hard to stay in hiding for so many hours of the day, being physically inactive and unable to walk in the light of the sun whenever you wish. Though you are more secure like this, you wish you were not forced to sit here like some rat. Yes... you do feel like a wretched rat...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6108;Unhappy times.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6110;You have been spending too much time hiding in dusty, cold cellars and not getting enough fresh air. It is said that the stale air of closed rooms is unhealthy if too much time is spent there. Indeed, you aren't feeling all that well right now...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6110;Cough.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6112;It's very boring to sit in hiding. The hours are long, and not many pleasures are available. Luckily, there's always the joy of a good strong meal.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6112;Bring in more food!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6114;Hiding from your enemies, you spend a lot of time just sitting around. As time passes, you feel yourself getting used to it. You find you don't have the energy for doing much work, but there's also no urgency, really.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6114;Oh, how I wish I were lying down...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6116;Life in hiding is not like normal life. You see very few people, everyone else is busy and it seems they have no time to come and see you. As time passes, you find that you start to get annoyed at the few visitors you do get. You just don't know what to say to people anymore.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6116;I wish they'd leave me alone.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6118;Life in hiding suits you, you feel much safer now than you have felt in years. It's always better to be safe than to be sorry. Or dead, surely. You're glad that you're getting this opportunity to reflect upon all the mistakes you've made in your life. You've been taking too many risks, but you will not be so foolish again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6118;There's no such thing as excessive caution.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6120;When people are out to kill you, and you sacrifice daily pleasures and companionship in order to hide from them, you do come to appreciate the little things in life and how much joy they can really bring you. Reflecting on this is making you see a new perspective, and suddenly the bigger issues seem less... big.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6120;One cannot be first in everything.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6122;Life in hiding is very limiting. You miss things like being outside, seeing people, enjoying good food and drink, games, merriment and companionship. When this trying time is over, you vow to compensate by living life to the fullest.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6122;Perhaps I'll even overcompensate!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6124;Spending your time hidden away from your enemies, you don't get much outdoors time, nor do you see many people. You have taken to making the time pass by reading. You did not expect, however, that such a wonderful new world would open up to you through these books...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6124;Learning never exhausts the mind.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6126;Trying to occupy your mind while hiding from enemy plotters, you have been reading some interesting new books that a friend acquired for you from a foreign bookmerchant.

EVTOPTA_CM_6126;Fetch me quill and parchment!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6128;Spending time in hiding, you find it hard to sleep at night. Your mind wanders, you feel restless. Someone once said that the restless soul needs to express itself, or it shall wilt and die. Perhaps you should pick up quill and parchment and write something?.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6128;I'll get the hang of this yet!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6130;Your daily religious observations will keep you safe. You say the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] ten times on the strike of each hour - first forwards, then backwards. Each time you do it, you feel closer to the unearthly and the divine. You can feel it stronger and stronger. Something is coming, something is changing...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_CM_6130;Praise [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_CM_6132;It's frustrating and boring to hide away from the world like this. You need a little something to put a warm glow on your days. Perhaps a drink would help... ah, that's good, this is working. Perhaps another one, just one...;;;;;;;;;x
