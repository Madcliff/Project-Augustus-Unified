EVTDESC6031_ALL;As the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] slowly pulled me out of the holy spring, the water started boiling and frothing, paint running off the arcane runes smeared on my naked body. Filled with wonder, I realized that the gibbering voices in my head had finally fallen silent!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC38309;The fog in my mind has lifted. I realize now that I used to be a Lunatic!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC38310;I have lost my absolute convictions and try to keep an open mind. I have lost the Zealous trait.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC38311;My frank bluntness won't get me into trouble anymore - I have lost the Honest trait.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC38312;I have learned to take pride in my actions and in my great family. I have lost the Humble trait.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC64130;Life is good!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_40;This morning I woke up with a painful itch. It seems [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] has seen fit to blight me with a minor pox for my sinful activities.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_40_NC;This morning I woke up with a painful itch... it seems I have contracted Lover's Pox.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_500;My confessor, [target_priest.GetTitledName] is such an attractive [target_priest.GetManWoman]! I've applied my ample charms and can tell [target_priest.GetSubjectPronoun] is thinking of other things than [target_priest.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_500;Give [target_priest.GetObjectPronoun] a taste of what [target_priest.GetSubjectPronoun] is missing!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_500;I do so love teasing the dear [target_priest.GetManWoman]...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_520;Recently, I have amused myself with seducing a handsome young guard. He follows me around like a puppy now... a very big, muscular puppy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_520;Make him a squire and keep him as my lover...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_520;Give him a tumble and I'll have the most loyal bodyguard ever!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_520;It's been fun, but I should aim higher.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_530;I've had my eye on a feisty young scullery maid with huge... intellect for some time now. Though she skillfully dodges the attentions of every boy and greybeard at court, I have her blushing furiously whenever I gaze into her eyes. Seduced and wrapped around my finger, this sharp lass could be very useful...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_530;Make her a lady and keep her as my mistress...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_530;Bed her and make her mine. What a spy she'll make!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_530;A common wench? I can do better!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_560;I see her flit past out of the corner of my eye, naked and red-haired, giggling - the nymph who lives in the garden. Always teasing me, never showing herself clearly. What must I do to win her heart?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_560;The magnificent old rose bush! She must be its spirit.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_560;Wait... why am I out here in my smallclothes at this hour?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_561;You enter the rose bush, professing your love.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_561;When I staggered out of the rose bush hours had passed, my head filled with carnal but vague memories. I am bleeding all over from the cruel thorns. The voluptuous dryad has exacted her price...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_561;Will I ever see her again?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_562;Today the servants found a newborn baby in a basket under the magical rose bush of my dryad lover!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_562;Proclaim that little [target_baby.GetFirstName] is my [target_baby.GetSonDaughter]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_562;[target_baby.GetFirstName] will be well cared for.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_570;The centaur beckons to me, massive muscles flexing. I have never seen anything more masculine in my life!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_570;I am overcome by his musky scent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_570;Wait... a centaur? In our stables?!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_571;You succumb to your desires.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_571;I came to in a state of bliss, mind filled with foggy images of the stunningly handsome centaur and our night of passion.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_571;Will I ever see him again?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_580;The misery of my captivity is only broken when I get to apply my charms on the gaoler. I can tell the ugly lout desires me... perhaps I can exploit his weakness to escape?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_580;Come here, handsome!';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_580;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_581;The gaoler unlocked the cell and entered, leering. As he started to fondle me, I suggested heading to a more romantic location. He burst out laughing, slapped me on the rump and left, snickering scornfully.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_581;I am sure his [Root.Host.GetMasterMistress], [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], will hear of this...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_582;My prisoner, [From.GetTitledName], attempted to use her female charms on the gaoler to escape. Fortunately, he did not fall for her wiles.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_582;Spunky! I say she has earned better quarters.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_582;Reward the gaoler for his integrity.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_582;The [GetRootFromInsult]! Throw her in the oubliette.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_583;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was so impressed by my initiative with the gaoler that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] personally escorted me out of the dungeon to better accomodations. It should be easier to escape from here...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_583;I am grateful.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_584;When my captor [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] learned of my seduction attempt, [From.GetSubjectPronoun] had me thrown in the Oubliette!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_584;The [GetRootFromInsult]! I will die in this hole...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_585;The gaoler unlocked the cell and entered, leering. As he started to fondle me, I suggested heading to a more romantic location. He eagerly snuck me past a few other guards to his own cot, where I had to do things I am not proud of... Then I bashed him on the head with a heavy jug, grabbed his keys and clothes and made my escape!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_585;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_586;My chief gaoler was seduced by my prisoner, the wily [From.GetTitledName]. He took her to his cot where she bashed him on the head with a wine jug and managed to make her escape!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_586;Throw the idiot in the Oubliette!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_590;My concubine, [target_consort.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], does not love me. While love is not exactly necessary, I'd still like to see her beautiful face light up with smiles and laughter... so I've decided to romance her!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_590;Turn on the charm;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_591;The seduction of [This.GetFirstName] begins;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_592;I did get my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] to laugh today, as I told her a silly joke about two squirrels. I think she is warming up to me...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_592_B;I can tell my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is finally falling in love with me. She snuggled up to me as we watched the sunset together from the roof of the great tower.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_592;Good, that gladdens me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_593;Thanks to my romantic efforts, sweet [From.GetFirstName], my [GetFromRelation], has also become my lover. It feels great to be rid of the cold awkwardness around her!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_593;Finally!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_594;Today, [From.GetFirstName], my [GetFromRelation], confessed that she has forgiven me for her abduction. She has grown to like her new life in [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]... and me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_594;I am relieved!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_595;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is not warming up to me at all. She laughs at my jokes, true, but not because she finds them funny, but with scorn. She told me outright that she despises me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_595;I'll just have to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_595;I give up. Perhaps I should put her aside...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_1150;Having many lovers is exciting and fulfilling. So much love, so much desire... but so little time! I feel like I'm burning the candle at both ends.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_1150;I can make this work!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_1150;Break up with [first_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_1150;Break up with [second_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_WOL_1150;Break up with [third_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_1160;My beloved [my_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is suffering from [my_lover.GetPossPronoun] bad marriage with [my_lover.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]. Perhaps I should suggest a romantic retreat to the countryside, just the two of us (and our most trusted retainers)?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_1160;I yearn for [my_lover.GetPossPronoun] embrace!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_1160;No. What if [my_lover.Spouse.GetFirstName] were to find out?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_1161;The suggestion is made. [This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] gets to decide...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_1161;Ripped pillows, broken furniture, shattered vases... My marriage to [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has devolved into an unending torment of bitter arguments and fiery rows. I would be depressed, but my lover, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], just suggested that we retire to the countryside for a few days of carefree romance and passion!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_1161;What a splendid idea!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_1161;No... let's be together right here under [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s nose!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_1161;I wish... but we can't risk it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_WOL_1161;We can't! The Watcher... he sees all!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_1162;We risk discovery by [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_1163;There is almost no risk of discovery by [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_1162;[From.GetFirstName] convinced me to stay in [From.Capital.Capital.GetName] so that we could be together right under [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s nose. We even made love in [From.Spouse.GetPossPronoun] bed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_1162;We are so naughty...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_1163;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] and I spent a few days of romance and passion in a country house far away from the prying eyes of [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_1163;I am so happy! Exhausted too...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_1164;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] declined my suggestion that we spend some time together alone in a country house, for fear of upsetting [From.GetPossPronoun] [From.Spouse.GetHusbandWife].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_1164;Such a wasted opportunity!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_1164_MAD;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] declined my suggestion that we spend some time together alone in a country house, mumbling about a Watcher with 'cruel eyes' who sees all...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_1164_MAD;My poor love, I fear [From.GetSubjectPronoun] is losing it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_1164_MAD_MAD;Aagh! Not the Watcher! I must hide...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2002;Life in the shadows is a risky affair - eavesdroppers can be discovered, plots can backfire, and vengeful victims come after you dagger in hand! I am not proud of what I do, but it is for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2003;Even the mightiest army can be defeated by a single [Root.GetManWoman]. Cut off the head and the body falls. I am [Root.GetFirstName] - [Root.GetMasterMistress] of Shadows.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2003;I shall rule from the shadows.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_2003;I shall strike terror into the hearts of my foes!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_2003;And yet, I won't let the shadows define me...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2050;I - and my trusted snoops and sneaks - will keep a very close eye on the activities of [From.GetTitledName]... a close eye indeed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2050;I wonder what secrets [From.GetSubjectPronoun] is hiding?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2061;There is no point spying on [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] anymore, considering [FromFromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] is dead!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2061;Time to turn my attention elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2062;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has ended up in prison, so there's no point spying on [FromFromFrom.GetObjectPronoun] anymore.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2063;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], the target of my current spy efforts, has tragically fallen comatose, making the endeavour pointless.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2064;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is no longer present in the realm, so there is no further point to my spying.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2071;My spying on [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] has revealed [target_spy_on.GetPossPronoun] complicity in a shadowy plot to [From.GetPlot]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2071;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2080;My snoops overheard [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] as [FromFromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] told shocking lies about [FromFromFrom.GetPossPronoun] rightful liege! How should I use this information?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2080_BASTARD;I have unearthed authentic love letters proving that [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] is actually a bastard!

EVTDESC_WOL_2083;[From.GetTitledName] was grateful, and upset, about the evidence I provided against [target_spy_on.GetTitledName]. [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] has been publicly denounced and humiliated!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2083;Muahaha!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2084;[From.GetTitledName] was grateful, and upset, about the evidence I provided against [target_spy_on.GetTitledName], and will use it to blackmail [target_spy_on.GetObjectPronoun] out of factionalism.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_2100;I have found out nothing new and useful about [target_spy_on.GetTitledName], but, as my shady informant pointed out, there is nothing preventing me from making stuff up. The bigger the lie...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_1;I have it! [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] likes to dress up as a [target_spy_on.GetManWomanOpp]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2100_2;How about a classic? [target_spy_on.GetSubjectPronounCap] takes little boys to bed!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_2101;The [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2110;One of my informants, a young soldier with more vices than he can afford, has managed to gain the trust of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and now often stands guard outside [FromFromFrom.GetPossPronoun] door. I don't understand how the fellow managed it, but who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth? For enough gold, he might be persuaded to get rid of [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName]... violently.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2110;Yes, that would be expedient.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_2110;Murder is going too far!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WOL_2111;[This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is attacked and hopefully slain...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2111_DEATH;I try to sit up in bed, but someone is holding me down! It's the burly armsman with the trustworthy face I promoted to the guard last week. Another assailant is trying to force a rag into my mouth. Holding my nose too... can't breathe...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2111_WOUNDED;I try to sit up in bed, but someone is holding me down! It's the burly armsman with the trustworthy face I promoted to the guard last week. There is a skinny little fellow with him, grinning viciously as he produces a dagger and stabs me! Screaming and thrashing about, I manage to kick the guard in the groin and break free. I punch the other one in the nose and rush from the room, trailing blood.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_WOL_2111_DEATH_KNOWN;[From.GetTitledName] sends [From.GetPossPronoun] regards!';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPT_WOL_2111_UNKNOWN;Unfortunately, the two assailants got away.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPT_WOL_2111_KNOWN;Under torture, the two men admitted that [From.GetTitledName] hired them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2112;In disguise, I meet up with my friend, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman and his shifty-looking associate at a run-down tavern. Grinning, he recounts how they stabbed [From.GetTitledName] to death in [From.GetPossPronoun] bed. I hand them a bag of coins and leave.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2112;Outside, I order my guards to tie up the loose ends...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2113;My spy, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman, managed to slay the [GetRootFromInsult] in [From.GetPossPronoun] bed. Unfortunately, he was captured trying to escape. My complicity is known!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2113;It was worth it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2114;In disguise, I meet up with my friend, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman and his shifty-looking associate at a run-down tavern. Shamefacedly, he recounts how they stabbed [From.GetTitledFirstName] in [From.GetPossPronoun] bed, and how [From.GetSubjectPronoun] somehow managed to get away. I pat him on the shoulder and tell him it's alright.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2115;My spy, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman, only managed to wound the [GetRootFromInsult]. Worse, he was captured trying to escape. My complicity is known!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2115;I hope [From.GetSubjectPronoun] dies from infection!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2116;In disguise, I meet up with my friend, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman and his shifty-looking associate at a run-down tavern. Shamefacedly, he recounts how they attacked [From.GetTitledFirstName] in [From.GetPossPronoun] bed, but how [From.GetSubjectPronoun] managed to break free and get away. I pat him on the shoulder and tell him it's alright.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2117;My spy, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s burly armsman, completely botched the attack on the [GetRootFromInsult]. Worse, he was captured trying to escape. My complicity is known!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2117;Incompetent bungler! I should have done it myself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2120;I have learned from my little birds that [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] plans to travel the realm incognito for a lark, mingling with the common folk. [FromFromFrom.GetSubjectPronounCap] will only be protected by two loyal friends during this little adventure - a great opportunity to have [FromFromFrom.GetObjectPronoun] abducted, if I so wished.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2120;Ah yes. It would suit my purposes marvellously!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_2120;No, I have no reason to do that.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WOL_2121;Some thugs are hired, with orders to bring me [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] alive.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2121;On a lark, I decided to travel among the common folk incognito with but a friend, a servant and a bodyguard. As we ride through a forest, an arrow suddenly sprouts from the neck of my trusty guard! Shouting a warning, I ride like crazy to get away...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPT_WOL_2121_CAUGHT;...but we are surrounded! No bandits, but the agents of [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPT_WOL_2121;...and manage to outdistance the bandits! Amateurs.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2122;My hired thugs managed to waylay [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and brought [From.GetObjectPronoun] to me in a sack!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2123;The thugs I hired failed to capture [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], though apparently they slew a guard and a servant in the attempt.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2123;Morons! You can't find good help these days...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2200;I have decided to free [From.GetTitledName] from the dungeons of [From.Host.GetTitledName]. It will take time - and likely some gold - but [From.GetFirstName] deserves a better fate!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2200;I'll probably need an agent in [From.Host.Capital.Capital.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2201;I have decided to liberate my beloved [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] from the filthy paws of her abductor, [From.Employer.GetTitledName]. It will take time - and likely some gold - but [From.GetFirstName] deserves a better fate!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2211;[target_captive.GetTitledFirstName] has tragically died in captivity before I had a chance to break [target_captive.GetObjectPronoun] out.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2211;Well, it was worth a shot!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2212;[target_captive.GetTitledFirstName] has tragically fallen comatose, making my endeavour to free [target_captive.GetObjectPronoun] rather pointless.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2213;[target_captive.GetTitledFirstName] is no longer a prisoner, so I can abort my plans to free [target_captive.GetObjectPronoun].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2221;I've approached [From.GetBestName] at the court of [From.Employer.GetTitledName] with my plan to liberate [target_captive.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetFirstName] is sympathetic and might be persuaded to take the risk...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2221;Put the plan in motion!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_2221;Bribe [From.GetFirstName] and go ahead with the plan.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_2221;Seduce [From.GetFirstName] and go ahead with the plan.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_WOL_2221;I've changed my mind. Abort the whole scheme.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2223;I woke from my troubled sleep with a start. Was that a thud outside my cell? Keys rattle in the lock and the door opens to a thin beam of light. It's [From.GetBestName]! 'Come with me quickly [Root.GetLordLady]! [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has hired me to help you escape!';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2223;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2224;I received some bad news this morning. My prisoner, [From.GetBestName] escaped from [From.GetPossPronoun] cell in the night. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] had outside help - one of the guards might never wake from the blow to his head...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2224_CONSORT;My concubine [From.GetBestName] has fled! She climbed out of her tower room window, probably with outside assistance, because my guards were completely unable to locate her before she escaped my realm.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2224;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] was surely behind this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2225;Good news! [From.GetBestName] was successfully sprung from captivity by the daring [FromFrom.GetBestName] and is safely back in [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2226;I woke from my troubled sleep with a start. Was that a thud outside my cell? Keys rattle in the lock and the door opens to a bright light. It's that ogre of a gaoler. 'This blighter attempted your rescue', he growls, and holds up a comatose [From.GetManWoman] like a ragdoll. '[Root.Host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] won't be too pleased, now will [Root.Host.GetSubjectPronoun]!?';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2226;Poor [From.GetManWoman]... was that [From.GetBestName]?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2227;The prison guards foiled an escape attempt last night. My treacherous [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetBestName] was captured trying to free [From.GetTitledName] from [From.GetPossPronoun] cell!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2227_CONSORT;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was almost abducted last night. The treacherous [FromFrom.GetBestName] attempted to 'rescue' her by climbing in through the window, but slipped and fell! When questioned, the concussed [FromFrom.GetFirstName] admitted that [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] was behind this chivalrous idiocy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2227;The dungeon is not secure enough. Throw [From.GetFirstName] in the oubliette!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_2227;Tighten security!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2228;The [GetRootFromInsult] [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] had me thrown me in the oubliette to make sure I don't escape!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2228;I will die here...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2229;Bad news... [FromFrom.GetBestName] failed to free [From.GetBestName] from [From.GetPossPronoun] captivity and was imprisoned [FromFrom.GetReflexivePronoun]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2229;Damnation! Security will be too tight now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2300;I watched from the shadows as my spymaster, [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], surreptitiously marked a spot on the wall with a piece of chalk. This might just be [Root.job_spymaster.GetPossPronoun] normal skulduggery, but my intuition says not...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2300;Time to spy on the spy;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2302;Eavesdropping from a secret passage in the walls, I overheard my faithless spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] talking to another conspirator. They are plotting to [From.GetPlot]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2302;Arrest [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] immediately!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_2302;Hold off. I will deal with this later.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2303;My snooping [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], apparently overheard me plotting murder and did not take kindly to my plans. I have been arrested!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2304;Over the last week, I have observed my spymaster [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] carefully and found nothing further to arouse my suspicion. Perhaps I'll just have to accept that odd behaviour goes with the job...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2304;I have more important things to do;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_2304;I can't take any chances. Have [Root.job_spymaster.GetObjectPronoun] replaced.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_2305;I have noticed my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] clumsily spying on me lately. It probably has something to do with [From.GetPossPronoun] unhealthy obsession with intrigue and an overly suspicious mind. I should be careful.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_2305;Lead [From.GetObjectPronoun] a merry chase!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3002;I would do anything for the family, but it is hard work cultivating loyalty and devotion not just towards me, but between all the disparate members of our great House. When I'm gone, the harmony and stability I leave behind will be my greatest legacy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_3002;Hear me roar!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3003;House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] stands firm on the rock of its proud [Root.GetPatriarchMatriarch] - [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;x 
#EVTOPTA_WOL_3003;I shall be like a lion, proud and admired;;;;;;;;;x 
#EVTOPTB_WOL_3003;I shall be like a falcon, fierce but protective of its brood;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_3003;No, I seek another lifestyle;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3010;I have been spending more time with my [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife] [target_spouse.GetFirstName] lately, and though of course we did not marry for love, I can tell it is growing between us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_3010;Ah, marital bliss!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3022;I have been making an effort to spend more time with my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] lately. We have not always seen eye to eye, but as [From.GetPossPronoun] liege, it is especially important to foster loyalty and respect.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3022_CHILD;My little [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] adores me, and I love playing with [From.GetObjectPronoun]. It is important to lay the groundwork for our future relations...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3022_ABROAD;I have been corresponding regularly with my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName], and always make sure to see [From.GetObjectPronoun] whenever I get the chance. It's a harsh world and family must stick together.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_3022;Family first!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3032;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName], the [GetRootFromCompliment] [From.GetManWoman], can always rely on me for aid. I try to help out whenever and however I can, out of respect, if not love.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3042;It is hard to find the time, but whenever I can, I try to spend some time with my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] must be made to see how important family is, and to honor and love [From.GetPossPronoun] parents!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3042_CHILD;As a reigning [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], I rarely have any spare time, but for my little [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] I would move heaven and earth!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3042_ABROAD;I have been corresponding regularly with my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName], and always make sure to see [From.GetObjectPronoun] whenever I get the chance to give sage advice and remind [From.GetObjectPronoun] of [From.GetPossPronoun] duties.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3050;I have noticed that [target_first.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_second.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] are not on the best of terms - a situation I hope to remedy! I have invited them both for some quality family time in [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3051;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has asked me to spend some quality family time in [From.Capital.Capital.GetName]. I am sure the idea is for me to become better friends with [target_second.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_3051;That sounds nice!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_3051;What idiocy! I think not.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3053;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] refused my suggestion. There will be no reconciliation with [target_second.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_3053;How foolish!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3054;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] refused my suggestion. There will be no reconciliation with [target_first.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3055;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] refused [target_initiator.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s invitation for us all to spend some time together in [target_initiator.Capital.Capital.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_3055;How silly of [From.GetObjectPronoun]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3056;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [target_initiator.GetFirstName] and I had a great time together! I feel we have really strengthened our family bonds.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_3056;We should do it again some time.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3057;[From.GetFirstName], [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and I had the greatest time together! I am sure they like each other better now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_3060;Constant fights and vicious pranks - my two children [target_second.GetFirstName] and [target_first.GetFirstName] just could never seem to get along, but my efforts to instill mutual love and respect have finally born fruit. This friendship will serve them well when I'm gone...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_3060;Who can you trust, if not your siblings?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6020_PARA;They are all watching me, conspiring... even my closest friends. Dark eyes, cold eyes... evil eyes.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6020_PARA;What do they want?!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6020_FEVER;The fever has broken - perhaps only temporarily - but I can still see the shadowy figures lurking in the corners. Are they real?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6020_FEVER;Who are they?!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6020_ZEAL;The dark stain of heresy has infected everyone around me. [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap] is winning the war for humanity's souls. No one is pure... except me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6020_ZEAL;They must all be cleansed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6020_PRISON;There are things in the walls. Things... Not rats, oh no! Not vermin at all... but scratching, watching, trying to drive me insane!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA6020_PRISON;I must get out of this hellhole!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC6020_COMA;I awoke from my unending nightmare screaming. I have been in the abyss, an indescribable darkness. How long have I been asleep? Weeks, years?!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WoL_5035_stag;During your hunt, you come to a deep gorge. Right on the other side is the white stag, staring at you! You are so close, yet cannot reach it. As it runs away, you realize that you must return home without a victory this time.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WoL_5040;Please join me at my court!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WoL_5055;You spend weeks in the wilderness searching for any trace of your prey, but are forced to return emptyhanded. You are sure that no one's impressed by your failed adventure.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WoL_5055;It's because my retainers are useless!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_5060;Fruitlessly scouring the countryside, you come upon a small cottage in the wilds. As you knock, an old crone opens.

EVTOPTA_WoL_5060;Sell it to me!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WoL_5061_bad;You drink the potion down. Soon, you start to feel all queasy, and then you pass out. As you awake, you have a strong headache and no desire to continue your hunting expedition. The old crone has disappeared, your guards don't seem to know how or where to.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_5061;I don't feel well...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WoL_5061;This feels good...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WoL_5065_female_lover;Fruitlessly scouring the countryside, you come upon a small cottage in the wilds. As you knock, a beautiful young woman opens. She pauses, then gives you a warm, inviting look and says: 'It's very lonely out here, I wonder if you will stay the night?';;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WoL_4112;Yes!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_4112;No!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WoL_4133;Ooh, that hurts!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_4133_talk;[From.GetTitledFirstName] started speaking to you calmly, explaining that there was no need to be upset. You considered for a moment, and then realized that [From.GetSheHe] was right. You ended up sitting down to eat and drink together again.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_4133;I honestly don't remember what I was so angry about.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_4133_hide;At the last moment, [From.GetSheHe] ran out, after throwing a chair at you and making you stumble. You searched everywhere but couldn't find [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WoL_4133;Maybe it's just as well. I'm not even angry anymore.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_4141;This party needs some action! I'm going to get undressed. Then perhaps, yes, I'll bring some animals in here, and maybe, yes that spear. And, and... set fire to the table, roast the food over it, then... where are my pants? Oh, right, I took them off! What now, hahaha, there you are, oh, ouch!! I just sat on the spear, how... amusing. I don't know, why is everybody laughing - this is great!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_4141;Pass me the wine!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WoL_4151;We're having a great time carousing. My comrades say I should slow down on the drink, but that's all nonsense.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WoL_6020;You have spent many nights looking at the stars in your observatory. It is truly fascinating, there are so many questions to ask...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6020;How do the stars move?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6020;Is there something... strange out there?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6100;Observing the movements of the stars at night, you have begun to see some regular patterns. These observations, however, have raised many new questions. You are starting to wonder, for example, if the Earth is really at the center of it all.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6100;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6110;The reasearch you conduct in your observatory at night is proving deeply fascinating. You could push your studies further, but you'd need to purchase more equipment for it to be meaningful.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6110;I must move forward!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6110;No, this is proving too expensive.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6122;One morning, your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] comes to see you. [From.GetSheHeCap] says: 'I am worried. I have heard that you are spending late nights studying the sky and entertaining heretical notions about the cosmos. I would ask that you stop, for your own sake.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6122;Don't worry, I'm fine...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6122;Stay out of my business!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WoL_6122;It is not what you think, I am only... writing poetry.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6130;You nightly studies of the movements of the celestial bodies are increasing your knowledge of a great many things. You feel that you are getting closer to understanding the universe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6130;I sense a harmony out there...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6140;Working in your observatory, lately you are often frustrated by broken equipment, weeks on end of cloudy weather and frequent interruptions by curious intruders and even animals. It's very hard to maintain concentration and get anything done.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6140;I must persist, the truth is out there.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6140;It's no use!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6152;Dear [Root.GetTitledName],\nI have been told that you are pursuing studies in fields that deny the truths of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. I am certain that such rumors are only slander and that you would never do such a thing. If it were true, however, I would be most disappointed.\n\nIn the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName],\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6152;The [From.GetTitle] should stay out of my business!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6152;The best answer to this is silence.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WoL_6152;I must not challenge conventional wisdom.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6160;You studies of the celestial spheres are progressing well. You see movements and relationships that you had never dared guess at. It seems clear to you now that the laws that guide the movements of the stars must also be reflected on Earth in some way..;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6160;And what is Earth?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6170;You are sure you have made a breakthrough in your studies. Yes, it cannot be otherwise. The Earth is round, and it revolves around the Sun. How little we know of the Universe!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6170;I must publish my findings!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6170;I will continue my studies in secret.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WoL_6170;I will stop with this achievement.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_WoL_6170;No! This is [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] speaking!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6300;Observing the stars at night, you have begun to sense some irregular movements. You also notice that some stars seem to appear and disappear at odd times. You need to study this more...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6300;That star there disappears when I look directly at it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6322;One morning, your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] comes to see you. [From.GetSheHeCap] says: 'I am worried. I have heard that you are spending late nights staring at the sky, speaking in odd riddles and entertaining heretical notions about the cosmos. I would ask that you stop, for your own sake.';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6322;I am only admiring the beauty of the stars.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6322;There are strange things out there and I need to see them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WoL_6322;What you heard are lies.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6330;The studies you have conducted in your observatory have convinced you that there are many strange things beyond the known cosmos. There are few sources and no one to share knowledge with you, however. But you have heard of a strange old scholar in the Arabian Desert who is rumored to possess vast knowledge of the weird.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6330;I will go and see him.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6330;No, this frightens me. I should stop.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WoL_6331;The Necronomicon;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6331;You arrive at the abode of the strange old scholar Ibrahim. After some persuasion, he invites you in. You speak at length, and he tells of you of the scholar Abdul the Mad, who knew many things of the strange spheres beyond and of talking beings that are not human. You find out that Abdul the Mad wrote a book called the Necronomicon, in which he recorded many strange and unholy truths. Ibrahim says that as he is impressed by your sincerity and desire for knowledge, he can sell you a copy of the book. He tells you to beware, however, as too much intense study of the Necronomicon is said to drive the reader insane...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6331;Yes, I must have it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6331;No, thanks.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6336;Shortly after the death of your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick], you are brought a strange piece of news. It seems that [From.GetHerHis] library was raided, the only item stolen being a strange old book of Arabian origin. Two servants who were in the library at the time were found dead, though witnesses refused to describe the state of the bodies.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6336;Strange...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6340;Working in your observatory, you are often disturbed by strange noises, uncannily large insects carrying away smaller pieces of equipment and odd human-like figures spying on you and then disappearing into the night before you can confront them. You really struggle to maintain concentration and get anything done.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6340;I must focus!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6340;It's no use, I should give this up.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6350;The book you bought from the strange desert scholar has proven quite useful for gaining new ideas and insights in your studies of the stars and what lies beyond. It does, however, contain some quite disturbing texts and images, things that lead towards a level of understanding that might make one... mad.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6350;I should leave it on the shelf for now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6350;I must delve deeper!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6360;Great wisdom comes to those who study the world and learn from it. Your studies of the stars and other things beyond this world have taken you on very strange paths, and your learning has increased immeasurably since you started.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6360;The stars are right!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_6370;You are finally certain, absolutely certain. There are things you understand now that lie beyond the ken of normal [Root.GetMenWomen]. If they knew, oh if they knew! But it is the task of scholars such as you to keep and preserve such things in secret, lest all humanity go insane with the knowledge of its own insignificance.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WoL_6370;I shall be a devoted keeper of elder secrets.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WoL_6370;I will hide this and dedicate myself to other things.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WoL_7020;I can't.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WoL_7021;Your visit to [holy_site_visiting.GetName] was certainly worth the time! You have wandered around in its sacred halls and pondered the atmosphere and the religious mysteries that lie hidden here.;;;;;;;;;x
