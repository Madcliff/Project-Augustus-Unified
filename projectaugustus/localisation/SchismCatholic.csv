mend_great_schism_catholic_desc;The Great Schism saw the Christian Church divided into two branches, but if a council could be successfully held with the Byzantine Emperor, there may be a chance to finally reunite Christendom.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPSHS.101;A Council is held to Mend the Great Schism.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.101;A Council to Mend the Great Schism;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.101;Despite practising what is essentially the same faith, the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have been at odds with each other since the Seven Ecumenical Councils. Now [From.GetTitledFirstName] has called for a council to heal this divide and re-unite Christendom, asking [Root.GetTitledFirstName] for [Root.GetHerHis] co-operation.\n\nThe conditions for re-union have been laid out by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and it is now up to [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bishops to decide whether this is acceptable or not. Of course, [Root.GetHerHis] subjects may reject the outcome of this council...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHS.101;We can repent later, give the Pope what he wants.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.101;I will never stand for this heresy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.102;The Pope is the universal head of the Church.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.102;The Pope is just first among equals!;;;;;;;;;x

enforce_chalcedon_catholic_desc;The Fourth Ecumenical Council saw the overturning of a previous synod headed by the heretic Eutyches resulting in the Christian Church being divided within Roman Empire. If the episcopal sees of these schismatics could be restored to the Catholic faith, there may be a chance to heal this ancient schism.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPSHS.103;The Coptic Pope receives a letter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.103;Review of the Council of Chalcedon;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.103;The Council of Chalcedon, or the Fourth Ecumenical Council, saw the split between those who spoke Greek and Latin and those who spoke other languages. The former became known as the "Melkites" while the latter were accused of "Monophysitism". Several subsequent councils to reconcile the two failed. Now [From.GetTitledFirstName] has called for a review of the Council of Chalcedon, asking [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to reconsider their Church's stance on the issue.\n\nThe conditions for communion has been laid out by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and it is now up to [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bishops to decide whether this is acceptable or not.;;;;;;;;;x 
enforce_ephesus_catholic;Enforce the Council of Ephesus;;;;;;;;;x 
enforce_ephesus_catholic_desc;The Third Ecumenical Council saw final condemnation of the heretic Nestorius. However, the bishops outside the Roman Empire were not invited, resulting in them siding with Nestorius. If the episcopal sees of these schismatics could be restored to the Catholic faith, there may be a chance to bring back these churches to the Mother Church.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIPSHS.105;The Patriarch receives a letter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.105;Review of the Council of Ephesus;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.105;The Council of Ephesus, or the Third Ecumenical Council, saw the split between the Church in Rome and the Church in Persia. Though it was used as a political tool by the Sassanid King, the latter group was accused of "Adoptionism". Several issues resulted from this including the split within Rome a few decades later. Now [From.GetTitledFirstName] has called for a review of the Council of Ephesus, asking [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to reconsider their Church's stance on the issue.\n\nThe conditions for communion has been laid out by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and it is now up to [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bishops to decide whether this is acceptable or not.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCSHS.108;As you and your fellow crusaders travel towards the Holy Land, you come across a group of Semitic people near Mount Lebanon. Upon further investigation, you learn that these people are Maronites, a community established by Saint Maron, thought to have been long extinct since the Monothelite controversy.\n\nThough they claim to have always been loyal to Rome, it has been centuries since they have had communication with the rest of Christendom.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHS.108;They are our long lost brothers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.108;They are heretics, establish the inquisition!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.109;Maronites Discovered;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.109;It has been centuries since the Christian community established by Saint Maron last had contact outside of Mount Lebanon. By chance the crusaders led by [From.GetTitledFirstName] had encountered a group of these people while they were on their way to the Holy Lands.\n\nPrior to the Islamic invasions, these people were accused of following the Monothelite heresy condemned by the Third Council of Constantinople. However, upon contact, the crusaders embraced them with open arms as fellow brothers in faith.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHS.109;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.109;Let us rejoice!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.109;Thank God for the crusaders!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.109;Embracing heretics? Typical.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.109;This is none of our concern.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.110;It has been centuries since the Christian community established by Saint Maron last had contact outside of Mount Lebanon. By chance the crusaders led by [From.GetTitledFirstName] encountered a group of these people while they were on their way to the Holy Lands.\n\nPrior to the Islamic invaisons, these people were accused of following the Monothelite heresy condemned by the Third Council of Constantinople. Showing their zeal for orthodoxy, the crusaders have decided to launch a full inquisition upon these people.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.110;So more heretics to deal with?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.110;Curse these crusaders!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.110;So the crusaders are useful for something.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.111;The New Patriarchate;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.111;With communications re-established between the Maronites and the rest of Christendom, the Maronites have re-affirmed their affiliation with Church of Rome. To commemorate the occasion, [From.RelHead.GetBestName] sent their leader, [Root.GetFirstName] a crown and a staff, elevating [Root.GetHerHim] to that of Patriarch of Boutron.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.111;God bless the Pope!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.111;Curse these Papists!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.111;They're still just mountain people.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.112;Order of Saint Maron;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.112;With the re-discovery of the Maronites, the crusaders had them detained under the suspicion of heresy. Having persecuted by the Byzantines and the Druze before, those who were able escape were outraged at how they were treated\n\nWith no one else to turn to, the remnants of the Maronites have decided to fend for themselves by militarising their community and taking up arms.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.112;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.112;We shall fend for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.112;Violence is the way of heretics.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.112;Oh dear...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.113;Maronite Catholics;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.113;Now that communion has been re-affirmed between the Maronites and the See of Rome, the Maronites have begun to flock towards the banner of the crusaders in retaking the Holy Lands in the name of Christ.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.113;They are no longer lost!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.113;Bah! They're still heretics.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTFSHS.113;Great, more infidels...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.114;Maronites Condemned;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.114;With the inquisition against the Maronites finally coming to a close, [Root.RelHead.GetBestName] has re-affirmed the Third Council of Constantinople and declared an anathema to all the Maronites as Monothelite heretics.\n\nUntil they fully repent and return in penance to the Church of Rome, the Pope has declared that all properties of the Maronites are forfeit.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.114;They shall be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.114;Was it not obvious?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.117;The Western Schism;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.117;The Antipope phenomenon was not a new thing, having existed since the early third century whether elevated by rival factions or secular rulers. However, the ascension of [From.GetFirstName] marks the first time an Antipope was chosen by the very same people who elected the sitting Pope, [Root.GetFirstName].\n\nWith an era of corruption of beginning in Catholic Europe, secular princes prepare to take sides as the future of their Church looms.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHS.117;Anathema to the pretender!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.117;I am the true successor of Saint Peter!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.117;God help our Mother Church!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.117;Rome should abandon it's false teachings!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.117;This of no concern to us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTFSHS.117;The fools bicker amongst themselves!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.118;An Olive Branch;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.118;With the existence of two claimants to the See of Rome threatening to tear Europe in two, the College of Cardinals has reached a decision to solve this issue by asking both claimants to resign.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHS.118;I do this in the name of Christ.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.118;We can only pray...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.118;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.118;These Latins are foolish.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.118;This of no concern to us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.120;A New Pope;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.120;Despite the impending crisis, the two sides have decided to resolve the matter peacefully, resigning their claim to the See of Rome and allowing the College of Cardinal to elect a new Pope in their places.\n\nThe crisis in Catholic Europe has been averted, though whether this is the last time such an event occurs remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHS.120;For the love of Christ.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.120;For the sake of peace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.120;Thank God!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.120;That was boring...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.120;This of no concern to us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTFSHS.120;That was uneventful...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHS.121;Three Popes;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHS.121;Although the Cardinals begged the two sitting claimants to resign for the peace of their Church, they have steadfastly refused to step down.\n\nIn the interest of restoring order, the College of Cardinals has decided to elect a third claimaint to the See of Rome. This gamble backfired, resulting in an unprecedented event of having three living rival claimants to Throne of Saint Peter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHS.121;Christ have mercy on us...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHS.121;The schismatics are having more schisms?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHS.121;This is the end for all Melkites.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHS.121;A deserving end for the infidels.;;;;;;;;;x
