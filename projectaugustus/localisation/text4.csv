DYN14_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the House of Godwin. On January 5th, 1066, Harold Godwinson became King of England. His father had spent much of the reign of King Canute building up the family power base and with the death of Edward the Confessor he was able to assume the throne. However, he wasnt the only claimant... Harald of Norway and William of Normandy both also claimed the title and invaded. Harald was defeated and killed at the battle of Stamford Bridge, but Harold would later be defeated and killed (along with two of his brothers) by William at the battle of Hastings. With his death, the power of the House of Godwin collapsed and its lands were divided amongst the victorious Norman Lords who followed William.;;;;;;;;;x
