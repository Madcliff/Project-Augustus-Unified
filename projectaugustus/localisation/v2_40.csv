EVTDESC107104;You currently have one unhappy Vassal. You can find this Vassal by clicking on your portrait and open the 'Vassals' tab. Try to increase the Opinion of this Vassal to a positive number. You can increase the Opinion of your Vassals towards you in several ways, for example by giving them more land (but do try to hold as much land as your Demesne Limit allows!). You can also give them an Honorary Title, or send them a gift. All this can be done in the Diplomacy Menu.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107009;When you have found a good character to marry, right-click on their portrait to open the Diplomacy Menu. Here you may ask the Liege of your intended about the possibility of arranging a marriage. The Diplomacy Menu is the main way to interact with other characters.

EVTDESC107300;You now have a Claim and it's time to let slip the dogs of War! Click on Canarias province and right-click the Ruler Portrait in the County View. Select 'Declare War' in the Diplomacy Menu and the 'Claim Canarias' Casus Belli. Send the War Declaration.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107301;Whenever you have Allies that can aid in your Wars, you will see an icon indicating this at the top of the screen. Clicking on this icon will open the Diplomacy Menu of your Allies, where you have the option to Call them to Arms, thus bringing them into your War (if they accept).;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107326;You are now over your Vassal Limit, meaning you have more Vassals than you can control. Your Vassals will then give you reduced Taxes and Levies, and you might even lose some Vassals when you die and your Heir takes over. In the long term you can increase your Vassal Limit by increasing your Diplomacy, but in the short term you can Transfer Vassalage so that you have fewer Direct Vassals. You can do this by clicking on the character you want to give Vassals to, and open their Diplomacy Menu. The target character must be of a higher tier than the Vassal you wish to give away.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107334;One of your children is now old enough to be Tutored by a Guardian. By opening your Diplomacy Menu you can select the 'Educate Child' option. A Guardian will be automatically suggested, but feel free to click on the suggested Guardian in order to choose another one if you wish. You will want a Guardian with good Traits and Attributes, or use this opportunity and let a Vassal that dislike you to get the honor of becoming the Guardian of your child.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107325;You are now over your Demesne Limit, meaning you have more Holdings than is seemly for you to rule personally. Your Vassals will dislike you for being over this limit, so you need to do something about it, and soon! In the long term, you can increase your demesne limit by increasing your Stewardship Attribute (and your wife's), but in the short term you need to give some of your Titles to your Vassals. You can do this by clicking on the character you want to give Titles to, and open their Diplomacy Menu. Look in the Character Finder or in the Court Tab in your Character View to find suitable characters.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC107310;You are now ready to make Peace. To do this, click on the War icon in the bottom right of the screen. You can also right-click the portrait of the character you are fighting and open their Diplomacy Menu.;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_30809;Isabelle was born in 1212 in southern Italy as the only child of Maria de Montferrat, Queen of Jerusalem. Her mother died shortly after giving birth, and the newborn Isabelle was proclaimed Queen with her father Jean de Brienne acting as her regent. At the age of 13, Isabelle was wed to the Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich II, effectively being used as a pawn to encourage the Emperor to participate in the Fifth Crusade. The wedding saw the Emperor crowned King of Jerusalem and Isabelles father stripped of all his powers. Isabelle herself was kept in seclusion by her husband. She lost a baby daughter before herself dying while giving birth to her son Conrad in 1228. Shortly after her death, Friedrich finally embarked on the promised crusade.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_93052;Inheriting the Khwarezmian Empire after the death of his father, Mohammed was immediately faced with an invasion by the Ghurids. Several chaotic years of intermittent war between the Khwarezmids, Ghurids and the Kara-Khitans ensued. Mohammed was at one point taken prisoner and held captive in the Kara-Khitan Khanate for a year, but changing fortunes would see him come out on top against his enemies, and he eventually managed to conquer Samarkand, Balochistan and Afghanistan and declare himself Shah. His reign came to an end sooner than expected, however, as Genghis Khan and the Mongols entered the scene in 1218. Within two short years, the Mongols had overrun his domain and he died a fugitive on a small island in the Caspian Sea in 1220.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_170193;Mystery surrounds Iltutmishs early years, though it is said he was named for an eclipse that occurred during his birth. He was sold into slavery at an early age, and eventually ended up being bought by Aibak, the ruler of Lahore. Aibak valued his new servant highly and kept giving Iltutmish increasing responsibilities and corresponding honors, eventually marrying him to his own daughter. When Aibak died in 1210, Iltutmish enjoyed strong support as he claimed the throne. Years of turmoil ensued as he fought off contenders and then strengthened his position. He subsequently managed to avoid open conflict with the Mongols, founding the Delhi Sultanate that was to last into the 16th century.;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_INFO_125501;Temujin was born in Mongolia, the son of the leader of the Borjigin clan. He was only a child when his father died, and he and his mother were ostracized from the clan due to his young age and competing pretenders. Once he reached maturity, however, Temujin began to forge his own destiny. Over several decades, he increased his reputation and prestige among his people, and eventually led them in the successful conquest of all Mongolia. After this, he went on to conquer northern China, all of Central Asia and parts of Persia and the western steppes. He became recognized as one of the greatest conquerors in the history of humanity, and the Mongols would continue expanding on these conquests after his death.;;;;;;;;;x
