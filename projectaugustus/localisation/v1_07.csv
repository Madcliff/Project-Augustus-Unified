REL_PENTARCHS_DESC;The Pentarchs were the original five Patriarchs of the Christian Church. Their authority as autocephalous Patriarchs over their respective ancient sees is still recognized within the Orthodox church. All five Orthodox Pentarchs must exist in order to heal the Great Schism within Christianity (Catholicism vs Orthodoxy).;;;;;;;;;x

BM_KOMNENOS_DYNASTY_DESC;After a series of devastating losses to invading Turkish forces, the Byzantine Empire is reeling. But there is hope - the great general Alexios Komnenos has just seized the throne from the corrupt Nikephoros III. Alexios - whose life was documented by his daughter Anna in 'the Alexiad' - and his successors would halt the decline of the Empire and push back the Turkish invaders from western Anatolia, buying more time for the ailing remnants of the old Roman Empire. For now, Anatolia is ruled by Suleyman I, a member of the Seljuk dynasty, who arrogantly calls his new state the 'Sultanate of Rum' (Rome).;;;;;;;;;x 
BM_THE_LATIN_EMPIRE;The Latin Empire;;;;;;;;;x 
BM_THE_LATIN_EMPIRE_DESC;The notorious and ill fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV, seeking to regain his lost throne. The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land. Meanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB94001;No, I have no time to waste on silly games.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94002;You seek out these kindred spirits.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94002;You make your way to the small hovel where the gaming enthusiasts have gathered. Your bodyguards kick open the shack's ramshackle door and announce your presence to the bewildered peasant teenagers inside. They are already sitting around a table, in the midst of a battle with their own painted little armies.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94002;Right then. Who will face me first?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94003;your great army meeting defeat on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94003;As your armored guards stand at silent attention along the walls of the hut, you do battle with your wooden army. The dice do not roll your way, but at least you have gained several valuable tactical insights. With his miniature cavalry surrounding the last of your army, one of the trembling teenagers asks in a meek voice:\n "D-do you y-yield, m'lord?";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94003;Yield? YIELD?! Guards, take this wretch to the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94003;I yield. Well fought, boy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94004;your wooden soldiers carrying the day.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94004;As your armored guards stand at silent attention along the walls of the hut, you do battle with your wooden army. The dice roll your way and soon your army is the last to remain standing on the table. The frightened striplings watch in silence as you gather up your wooden soldiers and turn to leave with your bodyguard.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94004;We shall have to do this again some time!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94005;As you make your way home late one night escorted by your bodyguard, you run into several drunken peasants having a fistfight in the middle of the street. Your guards attempt to steer you away, but you have an idea. Would this not be a perfect sparring opportunity in which to improve your martial ability?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94005;Put 'em up!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94005;No, these peasants are beneath me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94006;suffering a beating.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94006;After ordering your guards back, you join the wild melee. You get several blows in before the ruffians react to your presence, but things go poorly when you fight one of them on even terms. Soon you lie bruised in the mud, with the taste of blood in your mouth. Your smiling opponent offers his hand to help you up.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94006;Guards, deal with them! No survivors.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94006;Thank you for the lesson, friend.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94007;administering a beating.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94007;After ordering your guards back, you join the wild melee. As the ruffians become aware of your presence they gang up on you, but you are still able to hold your own. You dodge their blows and land several of your own. Soon the peasants are lying unconscious at your feet in the mud.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94007;Thank you for this dance, gentlemen, but I must be off.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94010;It is rumored that a great warrior from the distant east is currently passing through [Root.Location.GetName]. He is said to have taken part in a hundred battles or more, and his legendary fighting skills are supposedly without peer. Perhaps he could be persuaded to pass on some of his knowledge to you...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94010;This man must be found!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94011;After a long search you find the fabled warrior you had been looking for at a local inn. Reeking of spirits, the old man is soundly asleep under a table. His sword is of an unfamiliar make and the man's appearance certainly betrays his eastern origins, but could this really be the legendary fighter you seek? The innkeeper will not let him leave until someone pays his bill.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94011;Just another drunken fool.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94011;I will pay...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94012;You pay the old man's tab.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94012;As the old man struggles to recover from his hangover, you explain, in a quiet voice, your quest to improve your martial ability. You ask if he would teach you. He breaks into laughter and winces from the headache this produces. Then it dawns on him that you aren't joking. "Very well, [Root.GetFirstName]-san. I promise teach, you promise learn. I say, you do, no questions.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94012;You have a deal.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94012;No way, old man!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94013;Your training begins.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94013;The old warrior from the east has settled down in your castle, and your training is proceeding well. One day as you walk into his room, you see the man trying to catch a fly with the pair of small wooden sticks he insists on using whenever he eats. You inquire why, and he explains: "Man who catch fly with chopstick accomplish anything.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94013;What?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94014;Your training continues...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94014;You take a boat trip with your old warrior teacher on a nearby lake. As he fishes, you stand up in the boat and practise the moves he has taught you. "When am I going to learn how to punch?" you ask. The man rocks the boat and you lose your footing, falling into the water. You resurface to his roaring laughter. "Learn how punch, after you learn how keep dry! You all wet behind ear!";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94014;That's it, old man! I've had it with you! We're done!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94014;Sigh...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94015;As dusk falls after an intense day of sparring, you watch the setting sun from the castle ramparts together with your warrior mentor. "I teach you many things, [Root.GetFirstName]-san," your mentor says, "but most important lesson in fight... is no get hit." The next morning, your training concluded, the old warrior has departed your castle. No one saw him leave.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94015;Well, I suppose I learned something.;;;;;;;;;x

improve_stewardship_quit;You look for some other way to improve your stewardship.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94050;As you travel by carriage on a road in [Root.Location.GetName], you pass by what appears to be an old shuttered inn. The sight of it fills you with questions. What forced them to close down? Could you do a better job than the previous owners? Perhaps this would be a golden opportunity to improve your stewardship...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94050;It is settled! I will buy the inn!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94050;No, I will not sink any money into that ruin.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94051;You buy the inn and begin efforts to restore it.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94051;The vagrants in your new inn have been evicted, the holes in the roof have been patched and the whole building has been thoroughly aired out to cleanse it of the most offensive odors. New staff has been hired, and the time has come for you to decide on a name for your inn.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94051;The Bottomless Tankard!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94051;The Mead Fountain!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC94051;The Jester's Choice!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD94051;The Drunken Squire!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTE94051;The Crescent Oasis!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTG94051;The Frank, the Saracen and the Tartar!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTH94051;The Desert Watering Hole!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94052;A name is chosen.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94052;Things are very busy at your new inn, with everyone preparing for the grand opening night. Guests will be able to sample turnips for free, but if you added a generous amount of salt to them, people might become more thirsty and mead sales would increase...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94052;Add 10% salt!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94052;Add 20% salt!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC94052;Add 30% salt!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD94052;Add all the salt we have, damn you!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94053;The turnips are salted.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94053;Your inn will soon open to the public, but one last detail demands your attention before the opening night. Some form of act or spectable will need to be booked to keep the guests around. After scouring the lands for what passes for entertainment, you conclude that the following options are available to you:;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94053;A lengthy sermon on the evils of vice by a local clergyman.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94053;A travelling bard from distant lands.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC94053;A renowned eunuch castrato singer.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD94053;A wild ass that allegedly speaks and recites poetry.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94054;You book the clergyman.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94054;Probably not your brightest idea, but you invite the clergyman to speak at the grand opening of your inn. He conducted a sermon on the importance of leading a righteous and temperate life. The sermon lasted for some time, until the clergyman was too drunk to remain coherent... or stand upright.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94054;Sales actually improved...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94055;You book the bard.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94055;The bard you hired for your inn's opening night was from far away and spoke a peculiar language, yet despite this there was a strangely compelling elegance and rythm to his poetry and song. At least people seemed to think so. Sales were good, so you see no reason to complain.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94055;Keep the mead flowing!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94056;You book the eunuch.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94056;The eunuch's castrato singing was quite unlike anything you had heard before, but unfortunately a large fight errupted near the stage as people crowded around it to see where the shrill wailing was coming from. Your ears are still ringing from the singer's high-pitched shrieks when the fighting spilled onto the stage...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94056;At least the singing is over now.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94057;You book the wild ass.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94057;The wild ass sat on the grand stage of your inn for the better part of an hour, and although it relieved itself twice on the wooden floor, no speech or poetry was forthcoming. To your horror, the agitated animal then ran amok amongst the audience, resulting in fleeing customers and four broken tables.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94057;They... they told me it spoke! I swear!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94058;Well, that was a disaster. The people who sampled your turnips suffered violent bouts of illness, and the rest cleared out in short order after the first guests hurled their stomach contents on your floor.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94058;Too much salt?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94059;The salt trick actually seems to have worked! Who would have thought? The thirst of your guests seemed unquenchable and mead sales exceeded expections!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94059;I made a nice little profit.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94060;The opening night of your inn has concluded, and the time has come for you to move on from this venture and resume your other duties. Whatever else can be said, you have learned many valuable lessons on running a business. A buyer is ready to take the inn off your hands, at a tidy little profit for you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94060;It was nice while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94065;It has been brought to your attention that the large garden outside your castle is, frankly, a mess. Last week one of your courtiers got lost in that wilderness, and the man did not emerge for two days. Tackling this garden problem head on could be an excellent project with which to improve your stewardship.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94065;Time to stretch those green fingers!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94065;No, gardening is for weaklings and the clergy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94066;Together with your gardeners, you have redesigned your castle garden into a more managable form. You have organized the digging of a small canal system to keep your plants watered, the weeds have been removed and the hedge maze now actually has an exit. The skeletal remains strewn about the maze's dead ends have also been cleared out.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC94080;As you watch some birds darting nimbly through the air, you find yourself wondering why it is that man cannot do the same. There have been unsuccessful attempts to make flying contraptions in the past, but clearly those designs were all conceived by fools. Building a machine that can fly will help improve your learning...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94080;Yes! I am sure it can be done.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94080;No, we belong with our feet planted firmly on the ground.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94081;You begin your research.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94081;In your quest to build a flying machine, you spend countless hours with dusty old tomes and parchments in an effort to learn about all the failed attempts to fly, lest you repeat their mistakes. You are finally at the point where you feel you have learned enough to begin construction of a prototype.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94081;I will rule the skies.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94082;Construction begins!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94082;The prototype of your flying machine is nearing completion, but it would probably be ill-advised to pilot the thing yourself on its maiden flight. Fortunately, you know of several promising candidates who could probably be persuaded to take this historic leap of faith on your behalf.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94082;Otis, the cook's overweight son.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94082;Meldrick, local dung gatherer and dogsbody.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC94082;The dog belonging to the blacksmith's daughter.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD94082;al-Otis, the cook's overweight son.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTE94082;Ba'ah al-Drik, local dung gatherer and dogsbody.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94083;You enlist the aid of Otis.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94083;You find a suitably steep cliff from which to launch the maiden flight of your flying machine. Otis agrees to be strapped into the contraption, especially after you bribe him with sweets. You give him a gentle push over the cliff and leave the rest to fate and the wind. He plummets down like a sack of stones, trailing debris.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94083;Otis? Move your leg if you are still alive.;;;;;;;;;x

As you dive off the cliff, the machine disintegrates around you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94085;AAAAHHHhhhhh...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94086;You hurry down to the wreckage...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94086;After carefully examining the wreckage of your flying machine, you conclude that the physique of Otis was simply too much for its delicate frame to bear. At any rate, the ungrateful boy now refuses to have anything to do with your machines. It looks like you will have to fly the next prototype yourself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94086;I do this for the betterment of mankind.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP94088;The ground rushes towards you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94088;As you lie in your bedchamber, bruised and battered but still alive, you contemplate the nature of your plummet from the cliff.

EVTOPTA94088;Per ardua ad astra.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94089;You prepare a second prototype.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94089;With a new and improved flying machine, you return to the cliff. Otis waits below, as you will take the fateful plunge yourself this time. You close your eyes and leap into the air from the cliff. For a few seconds you feel the wind rushing past your face until something soft breaks your fall. It is Otis.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94089;I was flying! Otis, did you see? ...Otis?;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB94110;No, let the riff-raff sort out their own problems.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94111;You sponsor a meeting between the families.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94111;You have invited the two feuding families to a local inn hoping to reach some kind of agreement.

EVTDESC94113;"My friends," you say with as warm a smile as you can muster. "I think you know why I have called your great families here. As you suffer from this tragic conflict, the entire realm suffers with you.";;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB94113;Soothe their tempers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94114;"As some of you may know, my parentage has often been put into question," you start, rising from your seat. "There have been cruel whispers labeling me an 'inbred freak.' I know that many of you here have suffered the same injustices, and I come to you now as an understanding friend.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94115;You continue, in a harsher voice: "But at the same time, you have a duty and a responsibility to the crown! You fight each other on the street, and we look away. You ruin entire harvests for each other, and we look away. Not again. The line must be drawn here! This far, no furth - ";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94116;In a firm but kind voice, you say: "Many of you are angry, I know. You have every reason to be. Too much blood has been spilled between your families for things to be smoothed over, but there comes a time when one has to look to the future.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94116;Threaten them with violence.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94116;Lambast their childish behavior.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94117;For dramatic effect, you pull out a dagger and stab it into the table with all your might. "Because if you do not, I can assure you that there will BE no future for your families! I will personally hunt down every single one of you, and make sure that - ";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94118;You thump your fist on the table for dramatic effect. "In the end, are we not all adults here? It is so easy to resort to the bickering of children, for nobility and commoners alike, but that is when we must find the inner strength to rise above such pettiness! Let us walk out of here as the adults we are! What say you?";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94118;The peasants stand up in unison...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94119;It looks like things will be turning violent...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94119;You barely have time to dodge the chicken someone hurls your way. With a howl the two families leap over their tables and throw themselves at each other with you caught in the middle. Clothes torn and covered in bruises, you eventually manage to crawl out of the inn as the fighting continues inside...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94119;Well, I did my best...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94120;The inn turns silent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94120;Though it is doubtful whether they understood half of what you said, most of your message seems to have carried over. The peasants give a rousing applause.

EVTOPTA94120;Well, that went better than expected.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94098;You have come into possession of "The Confessions of St. Augustine," a series of tomes detailing the life and times of Augustine of Hippo, a Christian theologian from Roman Africa who lived many centuries ago.

EVTDESC94104;The cloth parts slightly to reveal the face of a gnarled old man. He regards you in silence for a moment with his beady eyes, then disappears behind the cloth again. "No solicitors!" he shouts.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94104;I have travelled far, old man! I will not be denied!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94104;Oh well. I'll be off again then.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94105;You don't take no for an answer and enter the cave.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94105;You push the curtain aside and enter the dark cave. Deep inside you find the hermit, seated on a cushion in flickering candlelight. He seems to be in some kind of trance at first, but then he opens an eye and looks at you with mild annoyance. "I thought I said... oh, spit it out then! What do you want?";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94105;I hope to share in your wisdom. May I stay?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94106;The hermit considers your request.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94106;After much badgering, the old man finally relents and permits you to stay for a few days. You observe him carefully and learn as much as you can. In the end, his "wisdom" seems limited to an endless stream of platitudes and maxims. You have memorized many, and at least they will make you seem more learned in the eyes of others.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94106;"Semper ubi sub ubi ubique.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94125;If you want to improve your skill at diplomacy, you need to become a confident public speaker. Swaying the hearts and minds of men with simple words is not an easy thing, but you have started practising in front of a mirror. Things can only improve.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94125;You talking to me?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94126;Your hard work practising public speaking in front of a mirror has paid off! You now feel much more confident when addressing others, and your skill at the art of diplomacy has likewise improved.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94126;Countrymen, lend me your ears!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94130;You are drawn to a large cheerful crowd standing in front of a tall building in [Root.Location.GetName]. It seems they have gathered to watch the antics of a man who has climbed onto the building's roof. The despairing man, tired of the hardships of life, is threatening to jump and several of the onlookers are goading him on.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94130;Don't do it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94130;I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94131;You rush forward to stop the suicide.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94131;You hurry inside the building and join the desperate man on the roof. "No! Stay away!" he cries when he sees you. You slowly climb out on the ledge next to him. "I just want to talk," you say as you edge closer.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94131;Grab the man.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94131;Talk to the man.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94132;You make an attempt to grab the man.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94132;You quickly reach out and manage to grab the man's wrist before he has a chance to jump. "Let me go, you cretin!" he screams. "I don't care who you are, you have no right to stop me from departing this wretched world!" Far below, you notice that some peasants have gathered a haystack to cushion the fall.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94132;Jump with the man.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94132;Pull the man inside.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94133;You leap off the edge together with the man, aiming for the haystack.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94133;A glint of madness flashes in your eyes and you smile at the man. "Do you really want to jump? Fine! Then we jump!" The man gapes at you, dumbfounded. "You... you're insane!" he gasps. Before the man can change his mind, you leap off the building and pull him with you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94133;Look out below!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94134;The ground rushes towards you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94134;You land safely together in the haystack. "Let's go again!" you exclaim as you brush the hay off your clothes. The shocked suicidal man pulls his arm away from you, and stumbles towards the crowd. "Get away from me! Help! That [Root.GetManWoman] tried to kill me, [Root.GetSheHe]'s insane!" As you walk away, you feel your grasp of diplomacy has improved.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94134;Mission accomplished.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94135;You pull the man safely away from the roof's edge.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94135;Mustering all your strength, you forcefully pull the man back to safety where he can be subdued by members of the city guard. He curses your name as he is dragged off to the dungeons - trying to take one's life is a sin, after all. You have learned the valuable lesson that sometimes actions speak louder than words.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94135;This applies to many situations.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94136;dissuading the man from leaping to his death.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94136;You speak gently with the distressed man, as if addressing a child. While keeping a safe distance so as not to alarm him, you lecture him at length about the wonders of life. You follow this with several long-winded anecdotes from your own life, including important moral lessons at the end. The man jumps.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94136;Well, at least I have learned what works and what doesn't...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94137;failing to prevent the suicide.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94137;You speak gently with the man, addressing him as an equal and a friend. As you talk, you carefully guide the conversation and subtly make him realize the folly of ending his life. To the crowd's dismay, he agrees to come down with you.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94137;I too have learned from this.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC94140;A local dignitary is visiting together with his pretty young wife. She wears a shining necklace, apparently some kind of priceless family heirloom. While he prattles on, your mind begins to wander. Suppose the bauble was to disappear? This could prove an excellent opportunity to better your skill at intrigue.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94140;Stage the theft of the necklace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94140;No, it would be too cruel.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94141;You wait for the sun to set.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94141;As night falls, you sneak into the guest room and carefully remove the heirloom from the neck of the dignitary's sleeping wife. She stirs slightly in her sleep, but does not wake. Now that you have the necklace, a worthless gewgaw, you need to decide where to plant it. Who shall take the blame?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94141;Magda, the cook's overweight wife.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94141;Meldrick, local dung gatherer and dogsbody.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP94142;The cook's wife will take the fall.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94142;You stealthfully place the necklace in the kitchen, where the cook's wife is sure to find it. Perhaps the poor woman will think it a gift from her husband... or a particularly generous pixie. With your work done, you retire for the night to see what will happen.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94142;This will be interesting.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94143;Morning arrives...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94143;The loud wailing coming from the guest room informs you that your little theft has been discovered. The dignitary and his wife are both unconsolable, and their grief over the missing necklace knows no bounds. Before they leave, you offer them a meal in the dining room.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94143;Magda, bring us some soup, please.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94143;Wafaa, bring us some soup, please.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94144;Soup is served by the cook's wife.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94144;The cook's wife serves the soup while the dignitary describes, in detail, how the necklace has passed from generation to generation in his family. Suddenly his wife emits a shrill cry and points at the massive wrist of the cook's wife. She is wearing the missing necklace as a bracelet!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94144;Guards, seize her!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94145;Your scheme is complete.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94145;After the necklace has been returned, the affronted dignitary and his wife soon depart. The cook's wife will have to endure a brief spell in the dungeons, but for a good cause - you have learned some valuable lessons in the art of manipulating events to your liking. Your skill at intrigue has increased.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94145;All's well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94146;You suddenly wake up in cold sweat. The cook's wife! You had her imprisoned for the supposed theft of a necklace all those years ago... but you forgot to let her out!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94146;M-Magda! Quick, to the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94146;W-Wafaa! Quick, to the dungeons!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94147;You are too late. The jailor explains that she passed away in a dark corner of her cell several years ago from the plague. Her remains were dumped together with the countless other thieves and cutthroats who perished in the same epidemic. This might explain why you caught your cook spitting in your stew the other day.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94147;Well, there's not much I can do about it now, is there?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94148;The jailor leads you to an especially dark and damp corner of the dungeon. He unlocks a rusty door to reveal an extremely thin and famished old woman. She looks up at you with frightened eyes and only then do you recognize her as the cook's formerly overweight wife.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94148;Why, Magda! You've... lost weight.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94149;The dung gatherer will take the fall.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94149;Disguised by a simple cowl, you present the necklace to your dung gathering servant, claiming it is a gift from a secret admirer. He is delighted, saying it will go well with the dirty rags he wears as clothes. With your work done, you retire for the night to see what will happen.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94149;This will be interesting.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94150;The loud wailing coming from the guest room informs you that your little theft has been discovered.

EVTDESC94151;Your servant dumps the luggage in front of the dignitary's carriage, but as he turns to leave, the dignitary's wife emits a shrill cry. She points at the shining heirloom around the servant's filthy neck. He gives her a toothless smile. "D'you like it, m'lady? 'Tis from a secret admirer, it is.";;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94151;Guards, seize him!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94152;After the necklace has been returned, the affronted dignitary and his wife soon depart.

EVTDESC94154;You are too late. The jailor explains that he passed away in a dark corner of his cell several years ago from the plague.

EVTOPTA94154;Well, there's not much I can do about it now, is there?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94155;The jailor leads you to an especially dark and damp corner of the dungeon. He unlocks a rusty door to reveal a disgusting ghoul.

EVTOPTA94155;Meldrick? On second thought, jailor, close that door...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC94070;To improve your stewardship and better learn how to administrate a realm, it strikes you that it might be a good idea to conduct a survey of the land. Trustworthy men would have to be sent out to every corner of your domains and record their findings. This information will then be collected into a single, great tome.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94070;Let us write this tome of judgment!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94070;No, I fear it would be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94071;The men are dispatched to survey the land.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94071;The men you sent out to survey the land have returned. You now have a precise count of the households, down to how many cows they own. This was a wise initiative, and your stewardship ability has increased.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94071;The [Root.GetTitle] sees all!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94160;It dawns on you one day that there is plenty of intrigue happening right under your nose. Your servants, from the kitchen maids to the stable boys, share juicy gossip with each other on a daily basis. If you want to improve at this twisted game of manipulation and deceit, then perhaps you ought to dive in and join the prattle!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94160;Said and done!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94160;Never!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94161;You join the servants' gossip sessions.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94161;Taking part in the gossip sessions of your servants has proved an enlightening experience. Not only have you learned of new ways to obtain sensitive information, but also that one of the milk maids is secretly carrying the blacksmith's unborn child!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94161;Oh, the scandal!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94165;By chance, you have learned that an old tailor in [Root.Location.GetName] once worked as spymaster for a local nobleman many years ago. The stories of his deeds and exploits are the stuff of legends. If even half of it is true, then this man could surely teach you a thing or two about intrigue.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94165;I will seek him out!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94165;No, this man sounds dangerous.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94166;You set time aside to pay this "tailor" a visit.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94166;As you visit the tailor in his modest shop, the harmless-looking little man feigns ignorance and for a moment you wonder if you have the wrong person. He kindly turns to fetch you some tea, but then suddenly, before you can react, he is standing behind you with a knife at your throat. "Who sent you?" he hisses into your ear.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94166;N-no one! I only wish to learn from you!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94167;The old man does not look convinced.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94167;After questioning you, the old man is finally satisfied that you're not there to kill him. He grudgingly agrees to teach you some of his tricks, if you promise to keep the secret of his past to yourself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94167;Agreed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94168;You begin your training.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94168;You have studied long and hard under the old spymaster in your sparetime, and he has taught you much about the game of cloak and dagger. Your intrigue has improved!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC94170;Your dynasty has become renowned for its decadence and the common folk view you with disdain. As a gesture to show them that you remember your ancient roots, perhaps you should leave the luxuries of your palace behind for a few days and spend some time with the desert nomads?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94170;Yes... for a few days.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94170;No, I refuse to live in filth and squalor!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94171;You spend some time with the Berbers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94171;You spend a few days in the deep desert with a Berber tribe. These are poor and simple folk, but their knowledge of the land and how to live off it impresses you. They treat you as one of their own, and when you finally return to your palace with your face and robe caked in dust, you have a newfound respect for these warriors.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94171;Time well spent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94175;A group of vicious highwaymen have been preying on travellers in [Root.Location.GetName]. Your scouts have discovered the location of their camp, but if you march an army towards them they will disperse long before it arrives. A small band of hand-picked warriors personally led by you might stand a better chance of capturing their leader.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94175;Yes, I will show them!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94175;I will not risk my neck to fight bandits!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC94175;Alas, I am too old for such heroics...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94176;You prepare to strike at the bandits.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94176;You select twelve of the bravest and most capable men from your personal levies. Together you set off towards the bandit camp and approach it under the cover of darkness. Their leader, a big one-eyed brute of a man, sits at a campfire with his lieutenants and is dividing up the spoils of their latest raid.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94176;Charge!!!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94176;This was a bad idea. Let's go home.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94177;The assault against the bandit's camp begins.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94177;Your men storm the bandit camp and cut down the startled highwaymen in droves.

EVTOPTA94177;L-Let's not be hasty! We can talk this over!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94177;My, I can't wait to see your head impaled on a spear.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC94177;It is a good day to die.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94178;You face off with the bandit leader.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94178;The fight was hard and the bandit leader's axe came close to splitting your head more than once. In the end, you managed to dig your blade into his unprotected flank and the brute was felled. The rest of the bandits were killed or rounded up by your men, and they will plague travellers no longer.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94178;A job well done!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94178;Help me with this head...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94180;There is a legend amongst the peasant folk of a two-headed albino dromedary stalking the desert sands after night has fallen. Their name for the beast is "Adh-Dhi'ban" - The Two Jackals. Organising a hunt for this unholy creature and mounting its two heads on your wall would make your dynasty seem less decadent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94180;A worthy quest. Let us slay this affront to nature.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB94180;I have not the stomach to face such a creature.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94181;You organize a hunt.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94181;You set out into the desert together with a local guide. He warns you that a mere gaze from the beast's four eyes has been enough to drive men mad in the past. You tell him not to worry, for you intend to pluck the creature's eyes from out of their sockets, and then boil and eat them. The guide looks queasy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94181;Let us not dally. Forward!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94182;You begin your search for this legendary creature.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94182;The search proves fruitless. At one point you thought you had found an even more twisted creature. Although not albino, this dromedary possessed not only two heads, but two bodies as well! Your guide then pointed out that it was two dromedaries standing next to each other.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94182;We waste time! That beast must be here somewhere!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP94183;You continue the search.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94183;The beast does not exist. Days of search has proven as much. You briefly contemplate taking the heads of two ordinary dromedaries and painting them white, but in the end decide it would be too much work. You and your guide head for home.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP94184;You return home in disgrace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC94184;To your surprise, when you and your guide return you are both hailed as heroes by the populace. They claim your courageous hunt drove the evil Adh-Dhi'ban away from the mortal realm for good. Men and women may now tread safely in the desert at night.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA94184;Well... of course!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65170;You have mastered the art of desert warfare. This difficult terrain provides many obstacles for an army to overcome, but also great opportunities for those who know where to look for them. Your forces will always fight better in the desert.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC65171;Forests and hills have become your preferred battleground. Using them to your benefit, you are better able to safely close the distance to your opponents or keep your forces away as the situation dictates. Your troops will gain an important edge in this terrain.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA65171;The land shall be my greatest ally.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65172;You no longer see fighting in difficult mountainous terrain as a disadvantage, but as an opportunity. The movement of your army is easier to obscure, and your opponents can be funneled towards battlegrounds of your chosing. If battle is joined in the mountains, your army gains an advantage.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA65172;The very mountains shall be my shield.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC65173;Large, open battlefields are where you fight best. When fighting in plains or on farmland, you are better able to array your army for battle and maneuver it to gain an advantage. Forces under your command will perform better in this terrain.;;;;;;;;;x
