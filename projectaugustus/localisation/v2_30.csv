EVTOPTA_WOL_55;Scandalous! They must be exposed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_55_UNHOLY;Unholy sinners! They must be exposed!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_55;The flesh is weak. Forgive and forget.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_60;[This.GetBestName]'s affair is exposed;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_56;[This.GetTitledName] is blackmailed;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_56;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. I know what you're doing with my [GetFromVsFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], you [GetFromRootInsult]. However, I understand the flesh is weak and would be willing to keep quiet about this affair for a small... donation.\n\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_56_CR;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. I know what you and your [GetFromFromRelation] are doing, you [GetFromRootInsult]. While you both sicken me, I am in dire need of funds would be willing to forget in return for a small donation.\n\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_56_HOMO;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. I've seen what you and my [GetFromVsFromFromRelation] are doing to each other, you [GetFromRootInsult]. Abomination! Yet, I am a kind [From.GetManWoman] and would be willing to forget in return for a small donation.\n\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_56;The [GetRootFromInsult]! I'll pay...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_56;I'd rather suffer the scandal!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_57;The money is sent to [This.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_57;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName]. Here, take my money. If you do not keep quiet, I will do things to you that you cannot even begin to imagine!\n\n[From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_57;Snooping can be so rewarding!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_59;To the [GetFromFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName]. Is this some kind of sick jest? [From.GetFirstName]'s virtue is immaculate! Do what you will, no one will believe your lies anyway.\n\n[FromFrom.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_59;Very well. I will enjoy this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_59;It was worth a try, but I'm not that cruel.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_60;Adulterous Scandal;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_60;[From.GetBestName] has been telling everyone that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] saw me and [FromFrom.GetFirstName] making love. The scandal is a fact.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_60_F;Poor [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. I didn't mean to hurt [FromFrom.GetObjectPronoun].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_60_M;Ah well. It is the Middle Ages!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_61;[FromFrom.GetBestName] has been telling everyone that [FromFrom.GetSubjecPronoun] saw me and [From.GetFirstName] making love. The scandal is a fact.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_62;[FromFrom.GetBestName] has exposed an affair between my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] and [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_63_CR;[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] cheated with [From.GetPossPronoun] own [GetFromVsFromFromRelation]!?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_81_F;It isn't easy bedding every man who catches my fancy. Jealous wives, watchful mothers, meddling courtiers, unwanted pregnancies - it takes skill to navigate such treacherous waters!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_81_M;Chasing skirts can be a dangerous business. Jealous husbands, watchful parents, eavesdropping maids... little bastards. By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], it's a wonder I'm still alive!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_81_HOMO;In this benighted age, pursuing other [Root.GetMenWomen] is fraught with danger. Yet, the risk of scandal makes it all the more exciting. Besides, there's no risk of unwanted pregnancies!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_81;I've learned a thing or two about Intrigue!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_99;My confidence is a mountain, my charm irresistible, my exploits legendary. I am [Root.GetFirstName] - temptation incarnate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_99;Move over Cleopatra!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_99_PERS;Move over Scheherazade!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_99;I can hardly resist myself!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_99;But... there are so many sins to explore!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_WOL_99;Naturally, but I won't let vices define me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_100;The Chase Begins!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_100;I shall bring all my seduction skills to bear on [From.GetTitledFirstName] until I have [From.GetObjectPronoun] wrapped around my finger!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_100;[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] will be mine!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_101;I have set my sights on [From.GetTitledFirstName], but the age difference could cause a bit of a scandal if the court gossips take notice of my efforts...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_101;But I love wrinkles!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_101;But [From.GetSubjectPronoun]'s such a little morsel!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_101;I should seek other quarry...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_102;A Game for the Whole Family;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_102;I have decided to seduce my own [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. The sheer taboo of it is thrilling, but the scandal... by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], the scandal would be epic.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_102;The risk makes it even more exciting!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_102;On second thought, I'm no deviant.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_103;The idea of seducing [From.GetTitledFirstName] - a [From.GetManWoman] of the cloth - is so exciting! Yet, I am definitely risking a scandal here...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_103;It will be worth it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_103;No, I fear [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] too much.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_104;Society may take a dim view on my preferences, but at the risk of a scandal I am about to seduce [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_104;With pride!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_104;It just isn't worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_110;I start planning my next move;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_111;The target of my seduction, [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], has tragically passed away!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_111;Well, there are more fish in the sea!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_112;My seduction of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has come to an unexpected end, as [FromFromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] has ended up in prison!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_112;I shall have get my thrills elsewhere;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_113;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], the target of my amorous attentions, has tragically fallen comatose and is now entirely incapable of appreciating my efforts.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_113;Seducing a vegetable is no challenge!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_200_CR;Today I found a scented letter lying on my pillow... I don't quite know how to react - it appears my own [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is quite smitten with me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_200;Oh, how romantic!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_200;How delightfully perverted!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_WOL_200;What foolishness!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_WOL_200;Fool. I am a married [Root.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTE_WOL_200;I am offended!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTF_WOL_200;What a sick deviant!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_201;Encourage this...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_202;My silence will dissuade [This.GetObjectPronoun].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_203;Strongly discourage [This.GetObjectPronoun]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_201;Letters of Love;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_201;I arranged for a scented love letter to be left on [From.GetFirstName]'s pillow in an attempt to woo [From.GetObjectPronoun]... and it seems to have struck true, for [From.GetSubjectPronoun] has left one on mine, confessing [From.GetPossPronoun] attraction to me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_201;Oho! Time to up the ante?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_201;Great, but I no longer desire [From.GetObjectPronoun];;;;;;;;;x 
WOL_SEDUCE_END_TOOLTIP;The chase is ended\n;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_202;[From.GetFirstName] has not responded to the love letter I had left on [From.GetPossPronoun] pillow.;;;;;;;;;x 
#EVTOPTA_WOL_202;Silence is not a no!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_202;Time to give up;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_203;I arranged for a scented love letter to be left on [From.GetFirstName]'s pillow in an attempt to woo [From.GetObjectPronoun]... Today I found [From.GetPossPronoun] answering missive in the privy. It did not smell of roses.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_203;A temporary setback!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_203;Time to move on;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_210;A Gift of Love;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_210;How romantic!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_210;How perverted... and thrilling!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_211;Gifts of Love;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_211;I sent [From.GetFirstName] a beautiful necklace and had her room covered with wildflowers. The gambit seems to have paid off, for I found a magnificent new saddle with her embossed seal in the stables today!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_211_M;I sent [From.GetFirstName] a magnificent sword as a gift. It seems to have warmed his heart, for he sent me a matching dagger back!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_211;Pretty clear symbolism, I'd say!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_211;I'm irresistible! But I've changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_212;I sent [From.GetFirstName] a beautiful necklace and covered her room with wildflowers, but I've heard nothing back from her...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_212_M;I sent [From.GetFirstName] a magnificent sword as a gift, but all I got in return was silence.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_212;It could have been worse!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_212;This is going nowhere.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_213;I sent [From.GetFirstName] a beautiful necklace and covered her room with wildflowers... Today I found my bed full of wilted petals and a bent, rusty nail on my pillow!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_213_M;Some time ago, I sent [From.GetFirstName] a magnificent sword as a gift. Today, I found it jammed into my loom, the weave completely ruined!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_213;[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is feisty! I love a good challenge!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_213;That's it, I'm wasting my talents!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_220;Rumors of Infatuation;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_220;I didn't credit it when my maid claimed to have heard that [From.GetTitledFirstName] can't sleep because he's constantly thinking of me, but now all my friends are saying it too!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_220_CR;The chamber maid claims to have heard rumors that [From.GetTitledFirstName] can't sleep because he's constantly thinking about me... My own [GetFromRelation], bless [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_220_M;I didn't credit it when my manservant claimed to have heard that [From.GetTitledFirstName] twists and turns at night in the grip of passionate dreams, crying out my name, but now my friends are saying it too!;;;;;;;;;x

My own [GetFromRelation], by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_220;How flattering!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_220;Unnatural! Why does this excite me?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_221;Conquest by Rumor;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_221;Some carefully placed words where they can easily be overheard by notorious gossips can be more effective than a love letter! [From.GetTitledFirstName] must have gotten my message, for I found a lock of hair wrapped in silk with [From.GetPossPronoun] personal seal in my chambers today.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_221;Hah! I shall have [From.GetObjectPronoun]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_221;Unfortunately, I don't want [From.GetObjectPronoun] anymore;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_222;Some carefully placed words where they can easily be overheard by notorious gossips can be more effective than a love letter. Or so I thought, but my quarry, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has not responded in any way.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_222;I need another tactic.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_222;Time to end this endeavor!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_223;I thought some carefully placed words where they could easily be overheard by notorious gossips would be more effective than a love letter... Well, [From.GetTitledFirstName] clearly got the message, for [From.GetSubjectPronoun] has started rumors of [From.GetPossPronoun] own about me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_223;Ingenious, but I won't give up so easily!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_223;Me and a horse?! I've had it!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_300;An Informal Event;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_300;My heart beats faster as [From.GetTitledName] grabs me for another dance. The hour is getting late, but the [From.GetManWoman] is such a charmer! I must be blushing like a beetroot.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_300_CR;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has danced with me all evening. I thought [From.GetSubjectPronoun] was just being sweet, but there is a strange tension growing between us. Something sensual, forbidden... thrilling.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_300_M;This minor event would be a dull affair, but [From.GetTitledName] just brushed her bosom against me again. Is she flirting with me..? That was definitely a wink! This is getting more interesting by the minute!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_300;Say something clever!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_300_F;Show [From.GetObjectPronoun] some cleavage...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_300_CR;Delicious sin! Lower my hands just a fraction...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_300;Give [From.GetObjectPronoun] the cold shoulder.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_WoL_302;[This.GetFirstName]'s advances are rebuffed;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTITLE_WOL_301;An Informal Event;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WOL_302;I need more practice;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_303;As the festivities wind down, [From.GetFirstName] takes my hands and looks into my eyes. '[From.GetMilordMilady], will you escort me to my chambers?';;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_303_F;The night's merrymaking is coming to an end. [From.GetFirstName] nods towards my rather inebriated attendant. 'She won't even notice us leaving...' [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] grins lasciviously and pats me on the rump.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_303;Sweet temptation, yes!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_303;I am not that kind of [Root.GetLadLass]!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_304;What a night! I think I'm falling in love with [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_304;I must have [From.GetObjectPronoun]!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_305;Just when things were really heating up, [From.GetFirstName] excused [From.GetReflexivePronoun] and left!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_305;What did I do?;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_306;I sure know how to cajole [From.GetMenWomen]! [From.GetFirstName] and I spent the night making sweet, illicit love in [From.GetPossPronoun] bed. I snuck off in the wee hours, leaving the court clueless... I hope!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_WOL_306;Let our love grow!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_307;As the festivities wound down, I took [From.GetFirstName] aside and suggested we retire together... I can't believe [From.GetSubjectPronoun] actually spurned me!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_WOL_307;The virtue is strong in this one...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_WOL_307;I don't have the patience for this;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_WOL_308;I thought I had [From.GetFirstName] completely entranced, but when I finally suggested we retire together, [From.GetSubjectPronoun] loudly mocked me and walked off with [From.GetPossPronoun] rather inebriated attendant, laughing cruelly!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_405;[From.GetFirstName] and I spent a long time making love in the water and on the warm cliffs above.
