buddhist_DESC;Buddhism was founded by the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, in Northeast India in the 5th century BC. The religion flourished in India for more than 1500 years, building huge libraries and monastery complexes, until Muslim invasions and the growing power of the Brahmin caste drove Buddhism out of the subcontinent. In the game, Buddhists get a significant bonus to Learning, meaning that they will research technologies faster.;;;;;;;;;x 
jain_DESC;Jainism is a religion of incredible antiquity, stemming from the ascetic Sramana tradition of India, in opposition to the priestly Brahmins and the caste system. The guiding principle of Jainism is Ahimsa - non-violence - which is more radically interpreted than in any other religion. In the game, Jains have a hard time waging offensive wars, but their remarkable tolerance means Jain rulers are well liked by all.;;;;;;;;;x
