EVTDESC_TOG_3400;Two mysterious hunters came to me recently, telling me that I should lie with [From.GetFirstName], my ugly, deformed wife, for she shall bear me a son who will become a great and mighty king. The wise men and wise women tell me that the hunters have powers of prophecy and magic, and that I should heed their advice.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TOG_3400;I refuse to lie with this ugly, buffalo-like woman.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_TOG_3400;The hunters are merely superstitious madmen.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3401;Your men have managed to hunt down the bear that has been killing livestock in nearby villages. The men are now calling for a feast in commemoration of the bear's spirit, called peijaiset. Since bears hold great symbolism in our life, it might not be wise to pass this opportunity.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3401;Of course! Let's also hope for his good reincarnation as a creature of the forest!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_TOG_3401;Sadly, I have no time for this.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_TOG_3401;Bear hides are valuable, so we'll sell it instead!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_TOG_3401;After enjoying the feast, I shall take the bear's skull to the sacred grove.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_TOG_3402;As you are out hunting one afternoon, a bearded elder approaches, donning a simple traveler's cloak and a wide brimmed hat that conceals his other eye. He greets you with courtesy, requests a horn of mead, and then informs you that just yonder, a well lies forgotten, filled with gold. He wanders off, chuckling as he goes, leaving you struck with the familiarity of his presence.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_TOG_3402;You inform your men that the wanderer was none other then Odin.;;;;;;;;;x
