EVTNAMESHH.102;A New Heresy;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHH.102;Due to the continued schism of the Catholic Church, there have been calls for reformation within the Papacy. One particular preacher has gone to an extreme of condemning the Papacy, the Crusades, and Indulgences.\n\nGrowing from an offshoot of the Lollard heresy, the 'Chalice People' have gathered in a huge following, posing a threat to Christendom in Europe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHH.102;I shall join these Chalice People.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHH.102;These heretics must be burnt!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHH.102;We believe in the same thing!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHH.102;Typical of these Papists;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHH.102;This of no concern to us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHH.103;The Papal Reformation;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHH.103;As the Papal Crisis continues, various bishops of Europe have gathered to deal with this potentially devastating situation. On his way to an upcoming council, the heresiarch of the Hussites was arrested on the charges of heresy despite Imperial protection.\n\nWhile the Pope and the Antipopes bicker on legitimacy, the Holy Roman Emperor must decide on how to proceed in regards to the future of the Church.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHH.103;Reformation is in dire need.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHH.103;Executing the heretic will solve this!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHH.103;God help our Mother Church!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHH.103;This may prove troublesome in the future...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTESHH.103;This is none of our concern.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAMESHH.104;The Hussite Wars;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCSHH.104;Having decided that ecclesiastical integrity was more important than reformation, the actions of the Holy Roman Emperor indicated that there was no reason for abandoning millenia old traditions.\n\nNot accepting such rationale, the followers of the executed reformer have gathered together and revolted, causing an unprecedented crisis in Western Europe.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTASHH.104;Curse these heretics!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBSHH.104;Down with the Papacy!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCSHH.104;This is of no concern to us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTDSHH.104;A deserving end for the infidels.;;;;;;;;;x
