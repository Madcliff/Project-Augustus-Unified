EVTDESC_REP_601;Money continues to flow through the Trade Post in [From.GetName], but your relationship with the merchant family that owns it has soured. To teach them a lesson without going to war, you could arrange for a mob to burn it down...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_601;Yes! Assemble the mob!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_601;No, things could quickly escalate out of control...;;;;;;;;;x 
tp_spare;You decide not to move against the Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_REP_602;An angry mob marches towards the Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_602;You and [From.GetTitledName] aren't exactly on the best of terms, and now it seems [From.GetSheHe] has encouraged an angry mob to burn down your Trade Post in [FromFrom.GetName]! Your small garrison has been surrounded, and the mob threatens to butcher them all unless you withdraw from [FromFrom.GetName].;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_REP_604;A bribe is offered.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_604;Envoys from [FromFrom.GetTitledName] have presented you with a significant bribe in the hope that you will use your influence to spare [FromFrom.GetHerHis] Trade Post in [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_604;Good. Have the crowds dispersed.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_REP_604;Ha! The fool will lose both his money and his Trade Post.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_REP_605;The mob disperses.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_605;[From.GetTitledName] is quite skilled at stewardship, and [From.GetSheHe] somehow managed to sway the mob by telling them of the wealth that flows into the province through the Trade Post. The crowd has dispersed and the Trade Post remains untouched.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_REP_605;Sigh. If you want something done...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_REP_606;[From.GetTitledName] has skillfully used diplomacy to somehow make the mob back down! The crowd has dispersed and the Trade Post remains untouched.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_REP_607;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the vile monster [From.GetSheHe] is, took the money you offered [From.GetHerHim] as a bribe, but still did nothing to spare your Trade Post. The mob stormed the garrison and the handful of survivors who made it back to [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] have provided chilling accounts of the brutality that ensued.;;;;;;;;;x
