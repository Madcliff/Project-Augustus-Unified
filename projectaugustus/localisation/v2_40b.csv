EVTDESC_HL_5051;A group of raiders are threatening the trade in our realm. My liege, [Liege.GetTitledFirstName], has ordered me to go after their leader, and make sure that the roads are safe for caravans.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5051;It is my duty.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_5051;I won't risk my life against the dangerous bandits.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTTOOLTIP_HL_5051;Refusing orders while give my liege a reason to arrest me.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5052;[From.GetTitledFirstName] brought forth to me the head of the raiders' leader, of the bandit leader whom previously plagued merchants in [FromFrom.GetName].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5052;Excellent work!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5053;In the late afternoon [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s horse arrived home riderless. There's no telling what the raiders have done to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5053;What a horrible fate.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_5053;I need to deal with these rascals personally.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_HL_5053;Get the soldiers to chase them out.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5054;The coward [From.GetTitledFirstName] deemed it too dangerous to interfere with the caravan raiders, and refused to carry out my orders. I could have [From.GetHerHim] arrested for this, however, that would not solve the problem of merchants being attacked on my trade routes.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5054;I need to deal with my unruly marshal.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_5054;I have to root out the raiders myself.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_HL_5054;Organize soldiers to take care of the raiders.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5055;[From.GetTitledFirstName] arrives bruised and alone from his venture to drive away the raiders. Unfortunately he brings the news that he has been unable to fight off the raiders from our land.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5055;Annoying pests!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5056;After the sunset I manage to track down the raiders encampment. Me and my men decide to...;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5056;... enter the camp and approach their leader.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_5056;... wait until midnight and sneak up on the guards.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5057;As we enter the camp, we pass clusters of tents and campfires. While I can only see a small group of raiders, I can feel many eyes upon me. Approaching the center of the settlement, a silhouette - who I assume is the leader of the raiders - exits a large tent, and greets me with a smirk.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5057;Fight the leader to shatter the band of raiders.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_5057;Bribe the raiders to leave my land.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTC_HL_5057;Diplomatically explain why they can't harass travellers.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5058;While engaged in a fairly one-sided conversation about property and rights, I fail to notice the thug sneaking up behind me. I just barely notice their leader making a subtle nodding motion before a sharp blow to the back of my head robs me of consciousness.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5058;Ow!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5059;I'm brought to consciousness by the sound of laughter and shouts. As my eyes adjust to the unforgiving sunlight, I realize that I have been tied up. The raiders have dressed me in silly clothes and are parading me around town, demanding a pile of gold in return for my freedom.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5059;Pay them for my freedom.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_5059;Plead for mercy.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5060;As we are closing in on the raiders' camp we count on the cover of darkness to keep us from sight. This turns out to be a foolish mistake, as we abruply find ourselves both surrounded and outnumbered.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5060;Surrender.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_5060;Let's dance!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_HL_5061;After subduing the guards on watch we enter the leader's tent. While he's fast asleep I draw my blade, placing it with great precision against his throat. Suddenly his eyes flicker open, and his gaze wanders the tent with a dazed urgency. I realize that if I do not act quickly, he may very well draw attention to us.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_HL_5061;Threaten him to leave my land!;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTB_HL_5061;Slit his throat and fight our way out.;;;;;;;;;x
